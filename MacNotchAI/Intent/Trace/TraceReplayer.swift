// THESIS (replay harness, M1 slice) — feeds a recorded JSONL trace back through the
// SignalBus, deterministically.
//
// Replay works because of the bus's core rule: events carry their own timestamp and
// downstream logic uses event time, never wall clock. Replay is instant (no sleeps) —
// windowing, decay, and (from M2) scoring all read `event.t`, so results are
// identical no matter how fast events are pushed.
//
// Golden traces — including the intent keyframes encoded from the formative
// observation sessions — thereby become regression tests: "did the pipeline see /
// score this real situation the way we expect?"
//
// NOTE: stop live sensors before replaying (IntentEngine handles this) — mixing
// live events into a replayed timeline would corrupt the buffer's time window.
