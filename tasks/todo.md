# AI Drop — App Store Roadmap & Review

## Website — Pricing page (DONE 2026-07-08)

- [x] Inspect existing static subpage structure and shared styles.
- [x] Add a Pricing page comparing Free and Pro.
- [x] Link Pricing from the existing website navigation/footer.
- [x] Verify syntax and browser rendering.

---

## Website — active page background gradient (DONE 2026-07-08)

- [x] Commit the current website state before touching the background work.
- [x] Add a page-wide black alpha gradient layer with multiple organic shapes over the Monterey wallpaper.
- [x] Tie the background layer to scroll with subtle parallax while keeping content and app UI fixed.
- [x] Replace the too-focused center swirl with full-page uneven black-alpha darkening patches.
- [x] Make the page-wide darkening more visible and add a very light wallpaper blur.
- [x] Split the background effect into separate patch layers so alpha and blur differences are visibly uneven.
- [x] Increase the base darkening and make patch movement/opacity respond more noticeably to scroll.
- [x] Darken the shared background further and make the scroll-driven ambient movement more obvious.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

---

## Website — Helvetica copy font test (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Add a Helvetica/Helvetica Neue website copy font stack for the temporary test.
- [x] Keep app demo text and UI controls on the existing SF/System stack.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

---

## Website — hero brand cleanup (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Add the dragaway logo above the Dragaway eyebrow in the hero copy stack.
- [x] Match the hero logo size/style to the footer brand mark.
- [x] Remove the "Speeding up..." claim row below the headline.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

---

## Website — replay tab push timing (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Delay the automatic file-type tab change until after the open demo window has faded out.
- [x] Keep the replay fade, empty-screen hold, file pop, and tool-pop choreography timings unchanged.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

---

## Website — initial tool/text pop choreography (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Disable the file-type toggle progress lighting again while keeping the auto replay tab push.
- [x] Create a website Git checkpoint after the progress-lighting removal.
- [x] Add the existing tool shell pop-in language to the initial boot animation without retiming the
      existing pill/drop/fill beats.
- [x] Replace the first-run `Your daily tools` write-in with quick per-letter pops coupled to the tool
      pop order/timing.
- [x] Make the initial pop visibly readable by adding a short pre-pop hold and slightly longer first-boot
      pop timing.
- [x] Refactor the first boot to use the same prelude handoff as the loop so radius and acceleration
      timelines stay unchanged.
- [x] Keep the outer tool rotation alive for the whole pop duration so there is no hitch when the last
      tool finishes appearing.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

## Feature — Smarter suggestions v2 (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-03 — build green; owner test pending)

- Catalog grown +18 actions (36 total): CSV (Summarise Table, Describe the Data, Show
  Trends, Find Outliers, Suggest Charts, Make a Report), Image (Analyse UI, Design
  Reference, Rebuild as HTML/CSS), Text (Draft Email Reply, Extract To-Dos, Extract
  Names & Contacts, Explain Simply, Proofread & Fix), Notes (5-Slide Outline, LinkedIn
  Post, Turn into a Brief), Code (Write Tests).
- Selection stays capped at 6; per-type pools are candidate lists, `reorder` promotes.
- `ActionFrecency` (Core): local per-category learned frecency (decayed counts in
  UserDefaults, no telemetry) — user's top-2 lead. Recorded in sendTurn.
- `FileSignals` extended: CSV header/numeric-column detection, email/todo/notes flavour;
  `reorder` gains filename-keyword rules (invoice/design/resume/notes) + primary URL.
- Honest scope: "Suggest Charts" recommends (no rendering — no code exec); Describe-Data
  row counts reflect the bounded peek on huge files; vision actions need a vision model.

## v1.2 slice — drag anything + streaming + history search (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-03 — build green; owner test pending)

Approved scope, build order:
1. **Sparkle build-gate** — wrap UpdaterController in `#if canImport(Sparkle)` (+ no-op stub)
   so the project builds before the package is added in Xcode.
2. **Drag anything** — pill wakes for TEXT / WEB-URL / IMAGE drags, not just files.
   `DropMaterializer` (new, Core) captures the payload at draggingEntered and writes it to
   Application Support/Drops on drop (.txt / .png, one shared 50-entry / 512 MiB quota that
   preserves files referenced by saved or live sessions) → the whole
   existing file pipeline (chips, AI, utilities, history) just works. Radial stays
   file-only (apps open files, not selections). Known trade-off: in-app text drags also
   show the pill — the drag hotkey gate is the opt-out.
   Backlog: fetch+strip web pages (URL drop currently analyses the URL string), file
   promises (Photos/Mail).
3. **Streaming responses** — `AIProvider.replyStream(…, onDelta:)` with a non-streaming
   default; real SSE for Groq+OpenAI (shared helper), Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama
   (hosted Worker stays non-streaming for now). First delta flips loading→result and
   appends a placeholder assistant bubble whose text grows in place (stable ChatMessage
   id so SwiftUI doesn't recreate the row). Window resizes once at completion.
4. **Session-history search** — search window (clipboard-picker pattern) filtering by
   filename + prompts + result text; row click reopens via the existing restore path.
   `maxSessions` 10 → 25. Menu: "Search Sessions…" atop Recent Sessions.

> Plan written 2026-05-29. Status of the codebase: feature-complete BYOK app, distributed via
> Developer-ID DMG. Goal: ship on the App Store with a metered free → paid model.
> **Nothing below is implemented yet — this is the plan to confirm before building.**

- [x] Add the speed stat banner to the hero boot choreography after the pill expands.
- [x] Animate the banner background in first, then reveal each metric sequentially.
- [x] Reuse the hero 8.8x count-up visual language for the banner numbers without coupling it to the hero copy.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

---

## Website — speed stat banner rewrite (DONE 2026-07-04)

- [x] Replace the visible study disclaimer paragraph with a compact three-column metric banner.
- [x] Keep the final speedup factor unchanged and add placeholder time/cost metrics.
- [x] Add hover information to each number and a bottom "Hover the numbers for information. Learn more" link row.
- [x] Update saved-time metric to 37.5s and calculate daily savings as $10.42 at 20 interactions/day and $50/hour.
- [x] Cache-bust touched assets and verify syntax/browser load.

---

## Website — cleaner hero loop transition (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Replace abrupt idle replay restart with a short replay prelude.
- [x] Fade the expanded window out before resetting the demo.
- [x] Show cursor/file briefly, fade tools in, then start the existing choreography unchanged.
- [x] Add a 600 ms empty pause after fadeout, then pop cursor/file before the tools fade in.
- [x] Delay the tool reveal slightly more and pop tools in one-by-one in a fast random order.
- [x] Keep the tools rotating while the replay pop-in sequence reveals them.
- [x] Smooth the handoff from replay pop-in to the normal orbit loop by separating outer rotation from inner icon pop.
- [x] Keep the replay pop-in radius pinned to the normal choreography's starting radius so the loop handoff does not jump.
- [x] Move the glass tile styling into an inner shell so the full tool tile pops in, not just the logo.
- [x] Cache-bust touched assets and verify syntax/browser load.

---

## Website — orbit radius peak timing (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Move the orbit radius peak 80 ms earlier without changing the shared drop/morph/fill timeline.
- [x] Cache-bust the touched website assets.
- [x] Verify syntax and browser load.

---

## Website — Learn more + Contribute pages (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Add a `learn-more.html` subpage covering pricing, data processing, AI/provider behavior, permissions, clipboard privacy, and beta/distribution details.
- [x] Add a `contribute.html` subpage with a simple name + message form that opens an addressed email draft.
- [x] Extend shared website styling for static subpages, FAQ rows, and the contribution form without disturbing the hero animation.
- [x] Link both pages from the main nav/footer and keep cache-busting current.
- [x] Verify HTML structure, browser load, form `mailto:` output, and console errors.

---

## Website — dragaway rebrand (DONE 2026-07-02)

- [x] Replace visible "AI Drop" branding with "dragaway".
- [x] Rename the first feature tab to "Drop" while keeping the demo behavior intact.
- [x] Use `assets/Dragaway.png` for the website icon/brand mark.
- [x] Switch visible brand logos to `assets/Dragaway-white.png` with no corner radius.
- [x] Verify the page in the browser.

---

## Website — hero text choreo polish (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Rework `Your daily tools` replay activation to use the same single shimmer behavior as `one drag away`.
- [x] Add a very subtle body-text shimmer when the supporting copy activates.
- [x] Verify in browser.

---

## Website — headline lead evenness fix (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Remove the horizontal white gradient hotspot from `Your daily tools`.
- [x] Remove the persistent lead-line glow/cutout after animation settles.
- [x] Verify in browser.

---

## Website — remove hero background cutout (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Disable the demo backdrop/scrim layers that create the vertical cutout under hero copy.
- [x] Verify in browser that no backdrop/scrim layer is rendered over the copy.

---

## Website — disable text loop choreo (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Keep the first hero text intro intact.
- [x] Disable the replay dim/re-light choreography without removing the code path.

- [x] Replace `Your daily tools` create animation with a simple immediate fade-in.
- [x] Tune the lead fade to start at 50 ms with a longer duration.
- [x] Replace the lead fade with a typewriter-style write-in reveal.
- [x] Verify in browser.

---

## Website — pre-ramp orbit radius polish (DONE 2026-07-03)

- [x] Make the tool orbit radius slightly larger before the spin ramp-up.
- [x] Ease it back into the existing radius during the ramp so the fly-in choreography stays intact.
- [x] Change the radius change into a visible animation: 0.9 → 1.2 → 1.0.
- [x] Revert the mistaken expand beat delay so the pill/card choreography keeps its previous timing.
- [x] Hold the radius at 0.9 for the first 80 ms, then grow to 1.2 before returning to 1.0.
- [x] Verify in browser.

---

## Feature — Scripts tab (5th chips tab) (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-06 — build green; owner test pending)

> Owner: a 5th "Scripts" tab where users save shell commands (npm run dev, git diff, …) and run
> them against the dropped file's project — skip Terminal + cd + typing. Forks (answered):
> run mode = per-script **Terminal vs in-app captured**; cwd = **dropped file's folder**, with a
> per-script **"Run in git root"** toggle. Non-sandboxed → `Process`/AppleScript allowed.
> SECURITY: user-authored only, explicit run, no destructive seeds.

- [ ] `Models/ScriptsStore.swift` — `Script {id,name,command,inTerminal,useGitRoot}` + store.
- [ ] `Core/ScriptRunner.swift` — cwd resolve + `{file}/{dir}/{name}/{root}` expand; Terminal (osascript)
      or captured (`/bin/zsh -lc` + Pipe → NSAlert). git-root = walk up for `.git`.
- [ ] `ChipsTab.scripts` + `ChipsLayout.rows`; OverlayView tab + content; Settings section; AppDelegate notif.

---

## Feature — Output Directory (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-05 — build green; owner test pending)

> Resolved fork: **session + persist tiers** + an **×** in the utilities row that resets to "same
> folder" FOR THE SESSION (modeled as `SessionOutput.sibling`, which beats even a persisted default).
> Session override is a tri-state on `OverlayViewModel`: `.inherit` (follow store) / `.sibling` (× →
> same folder) / `.folder(URL)` (picked this session). Cleared to `.inherit` in `reset()`.


> 2026-06-05. Owner: "In the utility tab, add the option to change the output folder with two
> checkboxes (Remember my choice / Remember my choice for this filetype) + a button to Settings. In
> Settings add an 'Output Directory' section, same logic as Favorite Tools: General + per-filetype,
> each filetype with a 'Use General File Directory' checkbox."

**Today:** every file-PRODUCING utility writes the new file NEXT TO the original
(`url.deletingLastPathComponent()` in each `FileTools`/`MediaTools` producer). No way to redirect.

**Checkbox semantics (my reading — confirm):** picking a folder always sets it as the **session**
output dir (used for the rest of this session). The checkboxes additionally PERSIST it:
- *Remember my choice* → save as the **General** output dir (`OutputDirectoryStore.general`).
- *Remember my choice for this filetype* → save as this file's **category** dir + set its
  `useGeneral = false`. Neither checked → session-only.

**Architecture — redirect by RELOCATING the output (minimal blast radius).** Producers stay
unchanged; the dispatch wrappers move the finished file into the chosen dir.

- [x] **`Models/OutputDirectoryStore.swift` (NEW)** — mirror `FavoriteToolsStore`. `@MainActor`
      `ObservableObject` singleton. `generalPath: String?` + `categories: [FileCategory: CategoryOutput]`
      where `CategoryOutput { useGeneral = true; path: String? }`. `resolved(for: FileCategory) -> URL?`
      (category path if set & !useGeneral, else general, else nil). Setters: `setGeneral/clearGeneral`,
      `setCategory/clearCategory`, `setUseGeneral`. Persist JSON in UserDefaults `outputDirectory.v1`.
      Skip dirs that no longer exist (best-effort).
- [x] **`OverlayViewModel`: `sessionOutputOverride: SessionOutput`** (tri-state — see header) —
      transient per-session override. Cleared to `.inherit` on `reset()`. Resolution (in
      `FileToolActions.effectiveOutputDir`): `.sibling`→nil · `.folder(u)`→u · `.inherit`→
      `OutputDirectoryStore.resolved(for: category(original))` → nil = original's folder (unchanged).
- [x] **`FileToolActions` (`UI/FileToolsMenu.swift`): relocate after production.** Add
      `relocate(_ output: URL, original: URL) -> URL`: resolve dir; if non-nil & different, `try?
      FileTools.move(output, to: dir)` (works for files AND the folder outputs of split/pdf→images);
      best-effort (return original output on failure). Call it in `runFile` and in `performAsync`
      before `presentFileResult`. **Producers + `FileTools`/`MediaTools` untouched.**
- [x] **Utilities tab UI (`OverlayView.swift` `.utilities` case)** — above the tool list: an
      "Output → <folder | Same as file>" row + **Change…** (`NSOpenPanel`, `canChooseDirectories`)
      → sets `sessionOutputDir` and persists per the two `@State` checkboxes; the two checkboxes; and a
      small **gear** button → posts `.showOutputDirectory`. Respect `@Environment(\.uiScale)` +
      `.liquidGlass`. Add its height to `ChipsLayout.rows(.utilities)` (≈ +2 rows) so the card sizes right.
- [x] **Settings (`UI/SettingsView.swift`)** — `SettingsSection.outputDirectory` (title "Output
      Directory"); an `outputDirectoryBody` mirroring `favoriteToolsBody`: a **General** folder picker +
      one row per `FileCategory` with a **Use General File Directory** toggle and (when off) its own
      folder picker. Add height in `settingsSize(for:)`.
- [x] **`AppDelegate`** — `Notification.Name.showOutputDirectory` + `handleShowOutputDirectory()` →
      `showSettings(section: .outputDirectory)` + register observer (mirror `.showFavoriteTools`).
      Optional: a menu item for parity.
- [x] **Build green** (`xcodebuild … Debug build`).
- [ ] **Manual test (OWNER):** run a producing tool with no dir set → writes next to original (as
      today). Set a session dir → output lands there. "Remember my choice" → persists as General,
      survives relaunch. "…for this filetype" → only that category redirects; others still General/sibling.
      Settings General + per-category + Use-General toggles behave like Favorite Tools.
- [ ] **Lessons:** capture if the post-production move has a gotcha (cross-volume, folder outputs).

## Feature — Smart suggested prompts, heuristics only (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-04 — build green; owner test pending)

> 2026-06-04. Owner: "how can we make the AI suggested prompts smart?" Fork resolved
> (AskUserQuestion): **Heuristics only** — reorder/filter the existing fixed `AIAction` list from
> LOCAL text signals. Zero latency, zero tokens, no provider. No LLM call. Stay (mostly) within the
> existing action vocabulary.

**Today:** `FileInspector.suggestedActions(for:)` is a pure `switch` on file *extension* → fixed
`[AIAction]`, baked synchronously into `Stage.chips(url:actions:)` at ~9 call sites. Content is NOT
extracted at drop time (that's lazy, on action-run). So a PDF always shows the same 5 chips.

**Approach — bounded synchronous content peek inside `FileInspector` (minimal blast radius).** Keep
the signature and all 9 call sites unchanged; make the body content-aware via a cheap, capped peek.

- [x] **`Core/FileSignals.swift` (NEW).** `nonisolated` `FileSignals.peek(_ url:) -> FileSignals`.
      Reads a CAPPED prefix only: text/code → first ~16 KB via `FileHandle` (instant); PDF → PDFKit
      first-page `.string`; else nothing. Returns struct: `dominantLanguage` (NaturalLanguage
      `NLLanguageRecognizer`), `hasManyDates`, `isShort`, `isLong`, `hasCodeFences`, `isMonetary`.
      Frameworks: Foundation + NaturalLanguage + PDFKit. Every read `try?`-guarded → empty signals on
      failure.
- [x] **`AIAction`: add `.translateEnglish` = "Translate to English"** (icon `globe`, systemPrompt).
      The one genuinely-missing case — needed so a non-English doc can suggest translating *to* English.
- [x] **`FileInspector.reorder(_ base:using signals:) -> [AIAction]`.** Stable reorder + light filter
      of the extension-based list. Rules:
      - non-English dominant → prepend `.translateEnglish`; drop the to-X target equal to the source.
      - `hasManyDates` or `isMonetary` → move `.extractKeyDates` (+ `.extractKeyPoints`) to front.
      - `isShort` → drop `.summariseBullets`; prefer rephrase/translate.
      - `isLong` → ensure `.summariseShort` + `.summariseBullets` lead.
      - `hasCodeFences` in a prose file (.md/.txt) → append `.explainCode`.
      - Always dedupe, never empty, cap ≤ 6.
- [x] **Wire it in.** `suggestedActions(for:)` = base map → `peek` (bounded, single URL) → `reorder`.
      `suggestedActions(forAll:)` = union extensions as today → `reorder` using the FIRST url's peek
      only (bounds multi-file cost to one peek). All `try?`-guarded → fall back to the static list.
- [x] **No stage-machine / `@Published` / async changes.** Call sites stay synchronous.
- [x] **Build green** (`xcodebuild … Debug build`).
- [ ] **Manual test (OWNER):** German PDF → "Translate to English" leads; invoice PDF → dates/points lead;
      1-line `.txt` → no "Summarise into Bullets"; long PDF → summarise leads; `.md` with a ``` fence
      → "Explain This Code" appears. Confirm no perceptible hitch on drop (peek is byte-capped).
- [x] **Lessons:** capture only if NL/PDFKit on the main thread during the deferred stage write hitches.

## Feature — Clipboard History (IMPLEMENTED 2026-06-04 — build green; owner test pending)

> 2026-06-04. Owner: "add a clipboard history. Users should be able to paste the past 10 items with a
> hotkey of your suggestion and see a history of 20 in a submenu saying Clipboard History."
> Forks resolved (AskUserQuestion): **capture = text + images + files**; **pick = copy-to-clipboard
> only** (no ⌘V synthesis — user presses ⌘V themselves); **persist across restarts** (App Support),
> sensitive/concealed pasteboard items ALWAYS excluded.

**Suggested hotkey: `⌃⌘V` (Control+Command+V).** Not bound by macOS or common apps, mnemonic (V),
easy chord. Registered via Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` so it's system-wide AND consumes the keystroke
(no leak into the frontmost app). Carbon hotkeys don't even need Accessibility.

**Store — `Models/ClipboardHistoryStore.swift` (NEW).** `@MainActor ObservableObject` singleton,
mirrors `SessionHistoryStore`. Polls `NSPasteboard.general.changeCount` on a 0.5 s `Timer` in `.common`
runloop mode (like DragMonitor, so it fires during drags/event-tracking). On change:
- **Skip sensitive types**: `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, `com.apple.is-sensitive`,
  `org.nspasteboard.TransientType`, `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType` (password managers set these).
- **Kind priority**: file URLs → `.files`; else image (`public.png`/`tiff`/NSImage) → `.image`; else
  string → `.text`.
- **Dedupe / move-to-front**; cap **20**; ignore our OWN writes via an `ignoreChangeCount` token.
- `ClipItem: Codable, Identifiable { id; kind; text?; filePaths?; imageFile?; date; preview }`.
  Images persisted as PNG in `clip_images/<uuid>.png` under App Support; metadata in
  `clipboard_history.json`. Trim/clear delete orphan image files.
- `copyToPasteboard(_:)` writes the item back (string / `[NSURL]` / image data) and arms the ignore token.
- Gated by a `clipboardHistoryEnabled` UserDefault (default true) → menu checkbox "Track Clipboard".

**Global hotkey — `Core/GlobalHotkey.swift` (NEW).** Thin Carbon wrapper: `register(onFire:)` /
`unregister()`, static C trampoline → shared instance → main-thread closure (no `self` capture in the
callback). Registers `⌃⌘V`.

**Picker popup — `UI/ClipboardPickerView.swift` (NEW) + a borderless `ClipboardPickerPanel`.**
`ClipboardPicker.shared` controller (mirrors `QuickLookController`): show/hide + monitors. Panel is
`canBecomeKey`, `.floating`, liquid-glass styled, centered on the active screen. Lists the **10** newest
items, each row = number badge (1–9, 0 for the 10th) + kind icon/thumbnail + 1-line preview + relative
time. **Click or number key** → `copyToPasteboard(item)` + dismiss; **Esc** / outside-click / resignKey
dismiss (local keyDown monitor while key + global outside-click monitor — same pattern as the tool
hotkeys / dismiss monitors). Empty state: "No clipboard history yet." Copy-only, so NO focus restore /
keystroke synthesis needed — the prior app refocuses on dismiss and the user hits ⌘V.

**Menu — `AppDelegate.buildClipboardSubmenu()`.** New "Clipboard History" item (next to "Recent
Sessions") → submenu of the **20** newest: 2-line attributed rows (preview over relative time) + a
32-pt kind icon/thumbnail; click → `menuCopyClipItem(_:)` copies to clipboard; ⌥-alternate removes one;
separator → "Clear Clipboard History"; disabled info line "⌃⌘V to open the clipboard picker". Empty →
"No clipboard history". Add a "Track Clipboard" checkbox item to toggle capture.

**Wiring — `AppDelegate`.** `applicationDidFinishLaunching`: `ClipboardHistoryStore.shared.startMonitoring()`
(if enabled) + register the global hotkey → on fire `ClipboardPicker.shared.toggle()`. Honor the
enable/disable toggle (start/stop polling + register/unregister hotkey).

**Invariants to respect:** poll timer in `.common` mode; no `self` capture in the Carbon callback;
exclude sensitive types (passwords); dedupe self-writes via the ignore token; delete orphan image files
on trim/clear; picker panel must become key to read number keys (accessory app → `NSApp.activate` then
`makeKeyAndOrderFront`).

**Files:** `Models/ClipboardHistoryStore.swift` (NEW), `Core/GlobalHotkey.swift` (NEW),
`UI/ClipboardPickerView.swift` (NEW, incl. panel + controller), `AppDelegate.swift` (launch wiring +
submenu + actions + notification/hotkey), plus docs.

**Tasks**
- [x] `ClipboardHistoryStore`: poll changeCount, kind detection, sensitive-type skip, dedupe, cap 20,
      image PNG storage, persistence, `copyToPasteboard`, ignore-token, enable toggle, clear/remove.
- [x] `Core/GlobalHotkey.swift`: Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` wrapper for `⌃⌘V`.
- [x] `UI/ClipboardPickerView.swift`: panel + controller + SwiftUI list (10 items, number keys, Esc,
      outside-click), thumbnails, empty state, liquid-glass styling, uiScale.
- [x] `AppDelegate`: `buildClipboardSubmenu()` (20 items) + "Clipboard History" menu item +
      `menuCopyClipItem`/`menuRemoveClipItem`/`menuClearClipboard` + "Track Clipboard" toggle.
- [x] `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching`: start monitoring + register hotkey → picker.
- [x] Build green (no new warnings — only the pre-existing NSEvent-Sendable / maxChars warnings remain).
- [x] Docs: CLAUDE.md (clipboard architecture + conventions), todo.md boxes, aidrop-summary.md §14, lessons.
- [ ] Owner test: copy text/image/files → appears in menu (20) and picker (10); ⌃⌘V opens picker, number
      key + click copy to clipboard, ⌘V pastes; password-manager copy is NOT captured; survives relaunch;
      "Track Clipboard" off stops capture + hotkey.

**Build notes (impl):** `ClipboardPicker` keyDown monitor must return `handleKey`'s result directly —
`self?.handleKey(event) ?? event` resurrects a swallowed key (nil → event), so number/Esc keys would leak.
Guard `self` first, then return the (possibly nil) result. Hotkey + poll are armed together at launch and
flipped together by `menuToggleClipboard` so they never drift out of sync.

## STATUS — 2026-06-01

- **Hosted-tier code: all DONE + build green.** Token-budget quota, model routing, 3rd tier, content caps.
- **D1 migrations: APPLIED** (owner) — `usage.tokens` + `accounts.pro` columns added.
- **`wrangler deploy`: confirm it ran** — the migrations are inert until the new Worker code is live.
- **Manual tests: PASS** (owner) — multi-file, Finder Quick Action, conversation, minimize, file tools, history.
- **Paddle / payments: DEFERRED on purpose** — wire up only if the app gets real usage. `isPremiumUnlocked`
  stays `false`; Pro is reachable solely by a manual D1 `pro=1` flag for testing. Bill is bounded
  meanwhile by `GLOBAL_DAILY_CAP` (2000 interactions/day) regardless of device-id spoofing.

## Feature — Favorite apps by file type (per-category tabs + General) (DONE, build green)

> 2026-06-02. Owner: "add in the favorite apps setting tabs for each file type (video, image,
> text, audio) and a general tab where users can either select other ones or tick a box which
> says Use General."

**Design (defaults chosen to preserve today's behavior):**
- `FileCategory` enum: `image / video / audio / text`. `text` = the catch-all (PDF, code, json,
  docx, plain text — everything droppable that isn't image/video/audio). Resolver lives in
  `FileInspector.category(for:)` reusing existing `isImageFile/isVideoFile/isAudioFile`.
- Store gains a **General** list + a per-category `{ useGeneral: Bool, tools: [FavoriteTool] }`.
  Each list capped at 9 (the ⌥1…9 range). Resolution for a dropped file =
  `category.useGeneral ? general : category.tools`. Session category = primary (first) file.
- **Migration:** existing flat `favoriteTools.v1` → General list; every category defaults
  `useGeneral = true`. So current users see no behavior change. New key `favoriteTools.v2`.
- Settings: segmented Picker (General | Image | Video | Audio | Text). Category tabs show a
  "Use General favorites" toggle; ON → note + hide list, OFF → that category's own editable list.
  General tab has no toggle.

**Tasks**
- [x] `FileInspector`: add `FileCategory` enum (+title/systemImage) and `category(for:)`.
- [x] `FavoriteToolsStore`: replace flat `tools` with `general` + `categories` (@Published);
      scope-aware `add/remove/move`, `setUseGeneral/useGeneral`, `tools(for:)`,
      `resolvedTools(for: [URL])`, `tool(forNumber:for:)`; v1→v2 migration in `load()`.
- [x] `ToolRow`: resolve list via `store.resolvedTools(for: vm.sessionFileURLs)`.
- [x] `AppDelegate`: hotkey handler uses `tool(forNumber:for:)`; `$tools` observer → store
      `objectWillChange`; `sizeForStage` two `.isEmpty` checks use the resolved list.
- [x] `SettingsView`: tabbed favorite-tools section (Picker + Use-General toggle + per-scope list).
- [x] Bump favoriteTools settings-window height (420 → 520) for the added Picker/toggle.
- [x] Build green.
- [ ] Owner manual-test: General favorites still launch; set a category to its own apps, drop
      that file type, confirm the row + ⌥N reflect the category list; toggle Use General back.

## Feature — "+" add tile + favorites row in result stage (code DONE — build green, needs owner test)

> 2026-06-03. Owner: "add a + (add) rect next to the favorite tool. Add those tools to stage 2 in
> the bottom left corner — same styling as on stage 1." (stage 1 = chips, stage 2 = result.)
> Design fork resolved (AskUserQuestion): **enable ⌥1…9 in the result stage too** (full parity).

- [x] `UI/ToolRow.swift`: trailing `AddToolButton` — a dashed-border "+" tile (same 40×40 glass
      footprint as `ToolButton`, no number badge) appended after the app icons in the `populated` row;
      tap posts `.showFavoriteTools`. Empty-state hint left as the single muted line (keeps the
      `toolHintHeight` height-math; the "+" only shows once ≥1 favorite exists).
- [x] `AppDelegate`: new `.showFavoriteTools` notification + observer →
      `handleShowFavoriteTools()` → `showSettings(section: .favoriteTools)`.
- [x] `AppDelegate`: tool-hotkey monitor now installed for `.chips` **and** `.result`
      (`observeStageChanges` switch + `handleToolHotkey` `inToolStage` guard) so ⌥1…9 fire in both.
- [x] `UI/OverlayView.swift`: `ToolRow()` added to the result-stage `leftColumn` **after the Spacer**
      (bottom-left), so it reuses the identical view → identical styling incl. the "+" tile. Sits in
      existing slack (≈350 pt content vs 380 pt min window) — no `sizeForStage` change.
- [x] Build green (`xcodebuild … Debug` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- [ ] **Owner manual-test:** chips stage shows "+" after the app icons → opens Settings ▸ Favorite
      Tools; result stage shows the same row bottom-left; clicking a tile launches; ⌥1…9 launch in the
      result stage; the favorites row isn't clipped at the shortest result (multi-file header + 5
      suggested actions is the tightest case).

---

## Feature — Utility result stage (Pillar 2 "second result stage") (IMPLEMENTED, build green — owner test pending)

> 2026-06-03. Owner: "we need a second result stage. If a utility was used, place the result file
> next to it (UI expands same as the result stage). Give the option Reveal in Finder (we know the
> path/URL). Show the relevant details of it AND the original file below each — e.g. for compress how
> much smaller. Same styling; expand the file pill downwards where the details are displayed."
> Forks resolved (AskUserQuestion): **scope = all file-creating ops** (rename in-place + Count/SHA-256
> alert unchanged); **auto-reveal in Finder AND show the card**; **rich detail** (size+delta, kind,
> type-specific line).

**New stage.** `OverlayViewModel.Stage.fileResult(original: URL, output: URL, tool: FileTool)`
(`tag = 5`; `fileURL` → original; `showsRightColumn` stays false). The root `OverlayView` switch
routes it to a new `FileResultView` (lands in the existing glass-card `default:` branch → keeps
window-drag/grabber/second-file banner).

**Detail facts.** New `Core/FileFacts.swift`: `nonisolated static func gather(_ url:) async -> Facts`
→ { name, sizeBytes (folder = recursive sum), kind (localized UTType desc), dimensions? (CGImageSource),
pageCount? (PDFDocument), duration? (AVAsset.load(.duration)), itemCount? (dir), isDirectory }. Heavy
probes run off-main in the view's `.task`; assigned to `@State` on return. Output pill also shows the
**size delta vs original** (e.g. "1.2 MB · 73% smaller" / "↑ 18% larger").

**View.** `FileResultView` (in `OverlayView.swift`), 500-wide to match the result stage:
header (tool result-title + matched `CloseButton`) · "RESULT" caption · `ExpandedFilePill(output)`
(icon+name on top, detail rows beneath — the "pill expanded downwards") · Reveal-in-Finder + Quick Look
+ ← back-to-chips buttons · "ORIGINAL" caption · `ExpandedFilePill(original)` · `Spacer`. Reuses the
glass styling of `SingleFilePill`.

**Dispatch.** `FileToolActions`: new `runFile(tool, original:) { op }` — reveal output in Finder (user
chose "both") THEN set `vm.stage = .fileResult(...)` via `DispatchQueue.main.async { withAnimation {…} }`
(stage-write deferral invariant). Switch every file-producing `perform` case from `run{}` to `runFile`;
`performAsync` (media) does the same after its output. Rename/Move/Count/SHA-256 untouched. Add
`FileTool.resultTitle` (past-tense labels: Compressed / Converted to JPEG / Merged PDFs / …; fallback `.title`).

**Wiring/sizing.** `sizeForStage` `.fileResult` → `CGSize(500, 410) * s`. Add the new case to the two
exhaustive `Stage` switches in `remapSessionURL` (remap `original`, leave `output`). Add a VM helper to
return to chips for the back button (rebuild `.chips` from `sessionFileURLs`). `observeStageChanges`
default branch already stops tool-hotkeys for non-chips/result.

**Files:** `Models/OverlayViewModel.swift`, `Core/FileFacts.swift` (NEW), `Core/FileTools.swift`
(resultTitle), `UI/FileToolsMenu.swift`, `UI/OverlayView.swift`, `AppDelegate.swift` (sizeForStage),
docs (CLAUDE.md stage machine + Pillar 2, this file, lessons if anything bites).

**Tasks**
- [x] VM: `.fileResult` case + `tag`/`fileURL`; `remapSessionURL` (both switches); `returnToChips()` helper.
- [x] `Core/FileFacts.swift`: async `gather`, folder recursion, delta formatting.
- [x] `FileTool.resultTitle`.
- [x] `FileToolActions`: `runFile` + `presentFileResult`; switch producers; `performAsync` sets stage.
- [x] `FileResultView` + `ExpandedFilePill` + `FileResultActionButton` in `OverlayView` + inner switch case + transition.
- [x] `AppDelegate.sizeForStage` `.fileResult` → `CGSize(500, 430) * s` (430, not 410 — headroom for 2 detail grids).
- [x] Build green (no new warnings).
- [ ] Owner test: compress a file → card shows output+delta+original, Reveal works, ← returns to chips,
      ✕ dismisses; image convert/resize shows dimensions; pdf→images shows folder item count; media op.

## Feature — Video/audio support (droppable, AI-free) (DONE, build green)

> 2026-06-02. Owner: "add video and audio file types as supported. Right now i cant drop a mp4."
> Media (video/audio) was listed as UNSUPPORTED → routed to the error stage. Made it **droppable**
> for Pillar 1/2 (Open-in + file Utilities) while keeping the **hosted AI OFF** for it. Critical cost
> reason: `FileContentExtractor` falls through to its text reader for unknown types and decodes binary
> as Latin-1 → would send ~24k chars of garbage to the model and burn operator tokens. Confirmed via
> AskUserQuestion: media stage = **Utilities + Open-in only** (no prompt field, no AI tabs).

- [x] `FileInspector`: `videoExtensions`/`audioExtensions` + `isVideoFile`/`isAudioFile`/`isMediaFile`;
      `suggestedActions` returns `[]` for media; `isUnsupportedFileType` **exempts media** (droppable);
      archives/installers stay unsupported (→ error stage).
- [x] `OverlayViewModel.setChips(url:)`/`setChips(urls:)`: default `chipsTab = .utilities` when primary is media.
- [x] `ChipsColumnView` (`OverlayView`): `isMediaSession`; content always shown for media
      (`isChipsExpanded || isMediaSession`); **prompt field hidden** for media; tab bar shows only the
      Utilities group; empty-Suggested hint added (defensive).
- [x] `FileHeaderView`: collapse chevron hidden for media (nothing to collapse to).
- [x] `buildMultiFileContent`: single-media → throws `unsupportedFileType`; multi-file loop skips media
      with a `[Media: … not analysed]` placeholder (defends mixed sessions from token waste).
- [x] `AppDelegate.sizeForStage`: media `.chips` branch (header+tabBar+content+toolRow+padding, **no prompt**).
- [x] Build green.
- [ ] Owner manual-test: drop `.mp4` / `.mov` / `.mp3` / `.m4a` → lands on Utilities (Show in Finder /
      Rename / Move / Compress), Open-in row works, NO prompt field, NO AI tabs; height fits with no gap;
      archive (`.zip`) / installer (`.dmg`) still shows the error card.

### Backlog — media-specific utilities (noted, not built)

Natural next step now that media is droppable (all AVFoundation/Speech, local + free):
video→audio extract, mov↔mp4, compress, trim, extract frame, video→GIF, mute; audio convert/trim/
normalize; **transcribe (Speech, on-device)** — the closest thing to an "AI" action for media, still zero API cost.

---

## Feature — File-utility expansion (Pillar 2): first batch + backlog (IN PROGRESS)

> 2026-06-02. Owner: "start with first batch, note down the rest." File utilities are LOCAL, FREE,
> offline native-framework ops (zero API cost) surfaced in the chips-stage **Utilities** tab. They live
> in `Core/FileTools.swift` (`FileTool` enum + `FileTools` engine), dispatched by
> `UI/FileToolsMenu.swift` (`FileToolActions.perform`), type-gated by `FileTool.tools(for:sessionFiles:)`.
> Window height auto-scrolls past 5 rows (`ChipsLayout.maxVisibleRows`), so longer tool lists are safe.

### First batch (BUILD NOW)

- [x] `convertToJPEG` — image → JPEG (covers HEIC/webp/png→jpg). ImageIO, orientation baked. Gated: images, not already jpg.
- [x] `stripEXIF` — image → metadata-stripped copy (EXIF/GPS/TIFF/IPTC nulled, NO re-encode via `CGImageDestinationAddImageFromSource`). Gated: images.
- [x] `pdfSplit` — PDF → one `.pdf` per page into a `<name>-pages/` folder. PDFKit. Gated: PDFs (throws if <2 pages).
- [x] `pdfToImages` — PDF → one PNG per page (`page.thumbnail(of:for:)`, 2×) into `<name>-images/`. Gated: PDFs.
- [x] `imagesToPDF` — session images → single PDF (`PDFPage(image:)`). Gated: images.
- [x] `prettyJSON` — JSON → pretty-printed, sorted-keys sibling. `JSONSerialization`. Gated: `.json`.
- [x] `compress` — any file/folder → sibling `.zip` (`NSFileCoordinator .forUploading`). Gated: always.
- [x] Wire `FileToolActions.perform` cases + `FileTool.tools` gating; **build green**.
- [ ] Owner manual-test: drop image (Convert to JPEG / Remove Metadata / Convert to PDF), PDF
      (Split into Pages / Pages to Images), `.json` (Pretty-Print), any file (Compress .zip);
      confirm Finder reveal + sibling outputs, no name clobber, Utilities row scrolls past 5.

### Backlog (NOTED, not built)

- **PDF (PDFKit):** extract page range, compress, rotate/reverse, delete pages, unlock/encrypt, watermark,
  extract embedded images, strip/read metadata, flatten annotations.
- **Images (ImageIO/Core Image/Vision/AppKit):** convert to PNG, read EXIF, remove background
  (Vision `VNGenerateForegroundInstanceMask`, 14+), rotate/flip/crop, @1x/@2x/@3x exports / app-icon set,
  grayscale, contact sheet, extract palette.
- **Text/Code/Data (Foundation/CryptoKit):** minify JSON + validate, CSV↔JSON, fix encoding / line endings,
  word/char/line count, sort/dedupe lines, tabs↔spaces, Base64 encode/decode, hash (SHA-256/MD5),
  Markdown→HTML/PDF/RTF.
- **Office (NSAttributedString):** DOCX→PDF, DOCX/RTF→Markdown/plain text, extract images from DOCX.
- **Audio/Video (AVFoundation) — expands supported types:** video→audio, mov↔mp4, compress, trim,
  extract frame, video→GIF, mute; audio convert/trim/normalize; transcribe (Speech, on-device).
- **Any file:** unzip, duplicate, copy to Desktop/Downloads, AirDrop (NSSharingService), Quick Look,
  copy path, .ics→Calendar, .vcf→Contacts.
- **Free local versions of AI actions (zero API cost, offline):** OCR (Vision), background removal (Vision),
  transcription (Speech).

## Feature — Text/Code/Data utilities (Pillar 2, BATCH 3) (code DONE — build green, needs owner test)

> 2026-06-03. Owner: "yes go" to the proposed Text/Code/Data cluster (the emptiest format — plain
> text/code today only get the universal reveal/rename/move/compress). All ops are LOCAL, FREE,
> synchronous Foundation/CryptoKit — zero API cost, no async (unlike batch 2 media), no parameter
> dialogs (unlike Trim/Resize). They surface in the chips-stage **Utilities** tab and the list just
> scrolls past 5 rows (`ChipsLayout.maxVisibleRows`) — no AppDelegate sizing change.

### Architecture decision — the one real change: an INFO presentation path
Batch-1/2 ops all produce a SIBLING FILE (revealed in Finder). Two ops in this batch (**Count**,
**SHA-256**) produce a VALUE, not a file. So `FileToolActions` gains a `runInfo`/`presentInfo` path:
an NSAlert showing the value with **Copy** + **Done** buttons (Copy → `NSPasteboard`). Everything else
reuses the existing sync `run { try … }` → reveal-sibling path. No new stage, no async, no enum flag.

### Gating (new `FileInspector.isTextFile` + `textExtensions`)
- **Text/code/data files** (txt/md/csv/json/xml/yaml/code/…): Sort Lines, Remove Duplicate Lines,
  Count (lines/words/chars), Base64 Encode.
- **`.b64` / `.base64`**: Base64 Decode (instead of Encode).
- **`.json`**: Minify JSON (alongside existing Pretty-Print), JSON → CSV.
- **`.csv`**: CSV → JSON.
- **Any file (universal, near Compress):** SHA-256 checksum.

### Build now — core set
- [x] `FileInspector`: `textExtensions` + `isTextFile(_:)` (plain-text/code/data exts; NOT pdf/docx).
- [x] `FileTools` (`import CryptoKit`): `sortLines` / `dedupeLines` (preserve trailing-newline),
      `countStats` (→ String), `sha256` (chunked FileHandle stream, hex), `base64Encode` (raw bytes →
      `.b64`, MIME 76-col), `base64Decode` (whitespace-stripped → `-decoded.txt`/`.bin` by UTF-8 sniff),
      `minifyJSON` (compact `JSONSerialization`), `csvToJSON` (RFC-4180 parser, column-order-preserving
      hand-built JSON, all values as strings), `jsonToCSV` (array-of-objects → CSV, union keys sorted,
      RFC-4180 quoting). New `FileToolError` cases: notTextReadable / invalidBase64 / invalidCSV /
      jsonNotTabular. Private helpers: readText / splitLines / writeSibling / jsonStringLiteral /
      stringifyJSONValue / csvField / parseCSV.
- [x] `FileTool`: 9 new cases (+ titles + macOS-14-safe SF Symbols); `isAsync` stays false (all sync).
- [x] `FileTool.tools(for:sessionFiles:)`: json block (+minify, +jsonToCSV), csv block (csvToJSON),
      text block (sort/dedupe/count/base64), universal SHA-256 before Compress.
- [x] `FileToolActions.perform`: 7 file-producing cases via `run {}`; Count + SHA-256 via `runInfo`.
      Added `presentInfo(title:value:)` (Copy → pasteboard / Done).
- [x] Build green (`xcodebuild … Debug` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- [x] Captured lesson (TEXT-01 INFO-path + CSV round-trip) in `tasks/lessons.md`.
- [ ] **Owner manual-test:** drop `.txt`/`.log` → Sort, Dedupe, Count (alert+Copy), Base64 Encode (.b64);
      drop that `.b64` → Decode round-trips; `.csv` → CSV→JSON; `.json` → Minify + JSON→CSV; any file →
      SHA-256 (verify hex matches `shasum -a 256`). Each sibling reveals, no clobber, no beachball.

### Deferred (need dialogs or are heavier — note, not built)
CSV/JSON type inference (numbers/bools — currently all-string, lossless), Base64 of arbitrary binary
from the menu (encode is text-gated for now), word/char count on huge files staying off-main, fix
encoding / line-endings / tabs↔spaces, Markdown→HTML/PDF/RTF.

## Feature — Quick Look preview on pill click (code DONE — build green, needs owner test)

> 2026-06-03. Owner: "can we add a preview compatibility when the file which is dropped is clicked?"
> Trigger chosen (AskUserQuestion): **single-click the pill**. Uses the system Quick Look panel
> (`QLPreviewPanel`, the Finder-spacebar preview) — NOT Finder-only; any app can present it. We're
> non-sandboxed and already hold the URLs, so images / PDF / video / audio / text / code preview
> full-size for free, with ◀ ▶ between multi-file sessions.

### Wiring
- `QLPreviewPanel` walks the **key window's responder chain** for a `QLPreviewPanelController`.
  `OverlayWindow` (NSPanel, `canBecomeKey == true`) implements the 3 informal-protocol hooks and
  points the panel's `dataSource`/`delegate` at the `QuickLookController` singleton.
- **Dismiss-monitor safety (verified):** the outside-click monitor only dismisses in Stage-1
  `.waitingForDrop`; preview is reached in chips/result, where outside-clicks never dismiss. Esc is a
  GLOBAL `NSEvent` monitor (fires only for OTHER apps' events) → Esc inside the in-app QL panel closes
  the panel, leaving the session open.

### Build now
- [x] `UI/QuickLookPreview.swift` (NEW): `QuickLookController` singleton + `QLPreviewPanelDataSource`
      (NSURL conforms to QLPreviewItem natively) + empty `QLPreviewPanelDelegate`. `present(urls:current:)`
      filters to existing files, makes the overlay key, opens/re-points `QLPreviewPanel.shared()`.
- [x] `UI/OverlayWindow.swift`: `import Quartz` + 3 overrides — `acceptsPreviewPanelControl(_:) -> Bool`,
      `beginPreviewPanelControl(_:)` (sets dataSource/delegate/index), `endPreviewPanelControl(_:)`.
- [x] `UI/OverlayView.swift`: `.onTapGesture` on `SingleFilePill` (whole icon+name row,
      `.contentShape(Rectangle())`, opens index 0) and `FilePill` (icon-only, opens that file's index).
      Subtitle copy → "Click to preview · drag to move". ShareButton stays outside the tap target.
- [x] Build green (`xcodebuild … Debug` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- [x] Captured lesson (QL-01: informal-protocol method name) in `tasks/lessons.md`.
- [ ] **Owner manual-test:** single-click single-file pill → QL opens that file; multi-file → click a
      chip opens that file, ◀ ▶ navigates; Esc closes the panel (session stays); drag-to-move still works
      (tap vs drag don't conflict); Share button still shares, doesn't preview.

---

## Feature — Media utilities (Pillar 2, BATCH 2) (code DONE — build green, needs owner test)

> 2026-06-03. Owner: "second batch, start with media utility. Eg: Extract Audio, Transcribe, convert
> to GIF and so + everything you just proposed." Scope confirmed via AskUserQuestion: **core set first**
> (no parameter dialogs); Trim/Normalize/GIF-options deferred. Video/audio are already droppable
> (batch-1 media work) but today only offer Compress(.zip) + Open-in. This batch gives them real value.
>
> **Cost posture (operator-bill-first):** EVERY op is 100% local / on-device — AVFoundation + the
> Speech framework. ZERO Gemini calls, zero proxy hits. Transcription runs on-device where supported
> (`supportsOnDeviceRecognition`); even the Apple-server fallback is Apple's free Speech service, NOT
> the operator's Gemini bill. This stays perfectly inside the cost priority.

### Architecture decision — async dispatch (the one real change)
Batch-1 utilities run **synchronously on the main thread** (`FileToolActions.run` → `try op()`),
which is fine for instant ImageIO/PDFKit ops. Media ops (export, GIF encode, transcription) are slow
+ inherently async → running them sync would **beachball**. So:
- New **`Core/MediaTools.swift`**: `enum MediaTools` with `async throws` static funcs (AVFoundation /
  Speech / ImageIO). Inherently-async exports use `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` over
  `exportAsynchronously` (macOS-14-safe; NOT the 15+ `export(to:as:)`). CPU-bound work (GIF frame loop,
  poster frame) runs **off the main actor** (continuation on a background queue) so the overlay stays live.
- New **`FileToolActions.performAsync(_:fileURL:sessionFiles:) async`** for the media cases (reveal on
  success, NSAlert on error — reuses `presentError`). Sync `perform` stays unchanged for batch-1 tools.
- **Loading UX:** reuse `MenuActionRow.isLoading` (already a per-row spinner + `.disabled`). `ChipsColumnView`
  gets `@State runningTool: FileTool?`; tap sets it, `Task { await performAsync(); runningTool = nil }`,
  taps ignored while one runs. NO new stage, NO AppDelegate change.
- **Window sizing:** unchanged — `utilityTools.count` grows, the list just scrolls past 5 rows with the
  existing bottom fade.
- **Permissions:** `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` is ALREADY in the pbxproj (both configs) → no
  Info.plist edit. First Transcribe triggers the system prompt; denial → NSAlert. App is non-sandboxed,
  sibling writes are fine. No new entitlement.

### Build now — core media set (no parameter dialogs)
- [x] `MediaTools.extractAudio(video) → <name>.m4a` (AVAssetExportPresetAppleM4A).
- [x] `MediaTools.transcribe(audio|video) → <name>.txt` (SFSpeechRecognizer + SFSpeechURLRecognitionRequest;
      `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = recognizer.supportsOnDeviceRecognition`; for VIDEO, extract audio to a
      temp m4a first then recognise; authorize via `SFSpeechRecognizer.requestAuthorization`).
- [x] `MediaTools.videoToGIF(video) → <name>.gif` (AVAssetImageGenerator @ fps 10, maxWidth 480, first ≤10 s;
      ImageIO `CGImageDestination` kUTTypeGIF, loop 0, per-frame delay 1/fps). Sensible defaults, no dialog.
- [x] `MediaTools.extractFrame(video) → <name>-frame.png` (AVAssetImageGenerator, midpoint, preferred transform).
- [x] `MediaTools.compressVideo(video) → <name>-compressed.mp4` (AVAssetExportPreset1280x720, .mp4).
- [x] `MediaTools.muteVideo(video) → <name>-muted.mp4` (AVMutableComposition, video track only, export .mp4).
- [x] `MediaTools.convertVideo(video, to:) → .mp4 / .mov` (Passthrough preset; retry HighestQuality on codec
      incompat). Offer Convert-to-MP4 unless already mp4; Convert-to-MOV unless already mov.
- [x] `MediaTools.convertAudio(audio) → <name>.m4a` (AppleM4A). Offer unless already m4a/aac.
- [x] `FileTool` new cases + titles + macOS-14-safe SF Symbols + `var isAsync` (true for the 9 media cases).
- [x] `FileTool.tools(for:sessionFiles:)`: video branch (transcribe, extractAudio, videoToGIF, extractFrame,
      compressVideo, muteVideo, convertToMP4/MOV) + audio branch (transcribe, convertToM4A). Compress(.zip) stays universal.
- [x] `FileToolActions.performAsync` dispatch for the new cases + `ChipsColumnView` runningTool wiring.
- [x] Build green (`xcodebuild … Debug` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`, no errors/warnings in new code).
- [ ] **Owner manual-test:** drop `.mp4`/`.mov` → Extract Audio (.m4a), Transcribe (.txt, permission prompt
      once), Convert to GIF, Extract Frame, Compress, Remove Audio, Convert to MP4/MOV — each reveals a sibling,
      row spinner shows while running, no beachball, no clobber. Drop `.mp3`/`.m4a` → Transcribe + Convert to M4A.
- [x] Captured lessons (MEDIA-01 AVFoundation async + Speech file-transcription) in `tasks/lessons.md`.

### DECISION NEEDED — dialog-requiring ops (defer or include?)
These need a parameter UI (start/end, fps, gain), so they're a bigger lift than the no-dialog core:
- **Trim** (video/audio) — needs a start/end range picker (NSAlert with two time fields or a slider).
- **Normalize audio** — peak/RMS analysis + gain (AVAudioEngine), heavier DSP.
- **GIF options** — fps / max-size / duration picker instead of fixed defaults.
Recommend: ship the core set first (covers Extract Audio, Transcribe, GIF, Convert, Compress, Mute, Frame),
add Trim/Normalize/GIF-options as a follow-up sub-batch.

### Still backlog after this (other clusters, unchanged)
PDF (page-range, rotate, delete pages, watermark…), Images (PNG, remove-bg Vision, rotate/crop, app-icon set…),
Text/Data (CSV↔JSON, hash, Base64, Markdown→…), Office (DOCX→PDF/MD), Any-file (unzip, AirDrop, Quick Look…),
local OCR / background-removal (Vision).

## Feature — Pre-release UI polish: menu-style action rows + OPEN IN hint (IN PROGRESS)

> 2026-06-02. Pre-release polish. Owner: "the pills should only be for PROMPTS." Actions (AI insights +
> file utilities) go back to **Apple-menu styling** (icon-left list rows, like the old ••• menu) — the
> `FileTool` utilities used to live in a native menu (commit d70a9db) before becoming chips. Confirmed
> via AskUserQuestion: **(1) scope = everywhere actions appear** (chips Suggested + Utilities tabs AND the
> result view's Suggested rail + follow-ups); **(2) look = neutral white hover highlight** (matches the
> dark card glass); **(3) ToolRow caption = "OPEN IN ⌥+"** two-tone (OPEN IN lighter grey, ⌥+ slightly darker).
> Typed prompts (History + Custom tabs) STAY pills.

- [x] **`AIAction.icon`** (`Models/AIAction.swift`): added an SF-Symbol per action (macOS-14-safe symbols).
- [x] **`MenuActionRow`** (new view in `OverlayView.swift`): leading SF Symbol + label, full-width, soft
      `white.opacity(0.10)` rounded hover fill; `isLoading` swaps the icon for a small spinner. Kept ≤
      `ChipsLayout.rowStride` so the chips-stage window-height math is UNCHANGED (no AppDelegate resize edit).
- [x] Swapped 4 render sites from `ActionChip` → `MenuActionRow`: chips `.suggested` (icon `action.icon`),
      chips `.utilities` (icon `tool.systemImage`), result `leftColumn` Suggested rail (+isLoading), result
      `followUpActions`. Left `.history` + `.custom` (and the customAddRow) as `ActionChip` pills.
- [x] **ToolRow caption** (`UI/ToolRow.swift`): replaced plain `Text("OPEN IN")` with `OPEN IN` (opacity
      0.40, lighter grey) + `⌥+` (opacity 0.28, slightly darker grey). Per-app number badges on the icons stay.
- [x] **Prewarm parity:** `OverlayPrewarmView` now warms `MenuActionRow` (the new leaf the real card uses)
      alongside one `ActionChip` (prompt pill), per its "same leaf views" invariant.
- [x] **Build green** (`xcodebuild … Debug` → `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- [ ] Owner manual-test: chips Suggested/Utilities render as menu rows with icons + hover; History/Custom
      still pills; result-stage rail + follow-ups are menu rows; loading spinner shows on a running action;
      "OPEN IN ⌥+" two-tone reads right; window heights unchanged (no clipping/extra gap).

## Feature — Model-weighted budget debit (budget = COST guard, not token count) (code DONE — NEEDS deploy)

> 2026-06-02. Owner caught the gap: the daily TOKEN budget was raw count, so a `gemini-2.5-pro`
> token (the Pro `extra` model) drained it the same as a flash-lite token despite costing ~18×. A Pro
> user spamming "Go deeper"/findBugs could stay "within budget" while the bill hit ~$15–23/mo. Owner:
> "weight the tokens by model. Be generous." Worker-only; closes the deferred §8 cost-credit item.

**Weights (relative to flash = 1.0; deliberately generous — compressed below true cost ratio):**
- flash-lite → **0.5** (cheap path rewarded; thrifty mode ≈ 2× effective headroom)
- flash → **1.0** (anchor; today's 30k/200k budgets keep their exact feel)
- gemini-2.5-pro → **4.0** (≈ its $/token vs flash; true ratio is ~4× flash / ~18× flash-lite)
- unknown/renamed model → 1.0 (never 0 — must not be a free pass)

- [x] `BUDGET_WEIGHTS` map + `modelWeight()` added next to `PRICES` (`worker/src/index.js`).
- [x] `handleComplete`: debit `billedTokens = round(tokensUsed × modelWeight(usedModel))` against the
      daily budget (and in the returned `usage`). Weighted by the model ACTUALLY billed (incl. fallback).
- [x] **`spend` roll-up stays RAW** (real prompt/completion tokens) so `/v1/stats` $ math is unchanged.
- [x] `wrangler.toml` budgets re-documented as "flash-equivalent" tokens; `node --check` clean.
- [x] Verified worst-case: Pro maxed 30 days now **$1.74–$3.84/mo** for ANY model mix (was $15.40 all-pro).
      Free maxed **$0.26–$0.58/mo**. Budget is now a real ~$4/mo cost ceiling at the pro budget.
- [ ] **USER ACTION:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy` (same deploy as thrifty mode below). (Agent can't deploy.)
- [ ] NOTE: the stored `usage.tokens` unit becomes weighted from deploy; existing rows reset at the next
      UTC day rollover anyway (budget is per-day), so no migration needed.

## Feature — Thrifty routing mode (FREE-tier cost squeeze) (code DONE — NEEDS deploy)

> 2026-06-02. Owner: current routing is "generous" for launch/first users (fine), but at scale the
> Gemini bill could hurt ("5¢ from ~10 debug runs as the only user"). Add a SECOND routing mode that can
> be swapped instantly. Confirmed decisions (AskUserQuestion): **switch lives in the Worker only**
> (`env.ROUTING_MODE`, no app/client change) and it **applies to FREE only** — Pro keeps the full
> generous ladder. Priority unchanged: minimise the operator's bill first; every failure mode biases cheap.

**Mapping (free tier):**
- generous (default, today): fast→flash-lite, strong→flash, extra→flash (free degrade)
- thrifty: fast→flash-lite, strong→**flash-lite** (the squeeze; `reasoning_effort:"low"` is already
  always-on, so "more complex" strong tasks still get a little thinking), extra→flash (real reasoning).
- Pro (every mode): fast→flash-lite, strong→flash, extra→gemini-2.5-pro — UNCHANGED.

- [x] `pickModel(env, tier, isPro)` (`worker/src/index.js`): added a `thrifty && !isPro` branch — extra→
      strong(flash), everything else→fast(flash-lite). Pro + generous fall through to the unchanged ladder.
      Unknown/missing tier still degrades cost (thrifty→flash-lite, generous→flash). Fail-safe preserved.
- [x] `ROUTING_MODE` added to `wrangler.toml` [vars], default `"generous"` (preserves launch behaviour).
- [x] Tier-fallback stays consistent: in thrifty, `strongModel` = flash-lite, so a failed extra(flash)
      call retries on flash-lite (cheaper) — biases cheap, never errors out.
- [ ] **USER ACTION (swap, no logic redeploy):** flip in Cloudflare dashboard ▸ Workers ▸ aidrop ▸
      Settings ▸ Variables ▸ `ROUTING_MODE` = `thrifty` (or `generous`). OR edit `wrangler.toml` +
      `cd worker && wrangler deploy`. (Agent cannot deploy.)
- [ ] **Owner cost-check after flip:** confirm free strong tasks (summarise/extract) now bill flash-lite
      via `/v1/stats`; Pro unaffected.

## Feature — Pillar 1 MVP: Favorite Tools + drop-to-launch hotkeys (DONE 2026-06-01 — build green; owner manual-test owed)

> 2026-06-01. First slice of the product reframe (`docs/VISION.md`): the notch becomes a router, not
> just an AI surface. Drop a file → a numbered row of YOUR apps appears → click or `Option+1…9` opens
> the file there. **Tool list = manual favorites** (owner decided). Smallest build that proves the
> "your tools, one drag away" story. AI chips stay — tools are an added lane, not a replacement.

**Design decisions (flag if you disagree):**
- Tools shown as a **numbered row inside the `.chips` stage**, below/beside the AI action chips
  (respects `uiScale` + `.liquidGlass`). Number badge = the `Option+N` it maps to.
- Hotkeys via a **local `NSEvent` keyDown monitor** installed only while the chips stage is live
  (no Accessibility needed — local monitors catch our own app's events; auto-removed on stage exit).
- Launch opens **all staged files** (multi-file aware) in the chosen app, then **dismisses** the overlay.
- Empty state: no favorites → row hidden + a one-line "Add tools in Settings" hint (no dead UI).
- Number assignment: auto `1…9` by order; reorder/remove in Settings.

**Plan:**
- [x] **`Models/FavoriteToolsStore.swift`** — `@MainActor ObservableObject`, PromptStore-style:
      `FavoriteTool { id, name, path }`; persisted as a Codable array in UserDefaults (`favoriteTools.v1`).
      `add(appURL:)` (dedupe by path, cap 9), `remove`, `remove(at:)`, `move`, `tool(forNumber:)`,
      `launch(_:with:)`. Icons via `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` (not persisted).
- [x] **Launch path** — `FavoriteToolsStore.launch(_:with:)` uses
      `NSWorkspace.open(_:withApplicationAt:configuration:completionHandler:)`. Opens ALL staged URLs
      (`OverlayViewModel.sessionFileURLs`); activates the app but leaves the notch session OPEN
      (owner chose keep-open over dismiss, 2026-06-01).
- [x] **Settings UI** — "Favorite Tools" section in `SettingsView`: add via `NSOpenPanel`
      (`.application`, default `/Applications`), list with icon + name + `⌥N` badge, remove, `.onMove`
      reorder. "Add App…" disabled at the 9 cap.
- [x] **Tool row view** — `UI/ToolRow.swift` in the chips stage (expanded): horizontal "OPEN IN" icon
      row, number badge per app, click → launch. Empty → one muted hint line. Height fed through
      `AppDelegate.sizeForStage` via `ChipsLayout.toolRowHeight`/`.toolHintHeight` (Combine loop, not
      SwiftUI layout) + a `FavoriteToolsStore.$tools` resize observer.
- [x] **Hotkeys** — chips-stage-scoped local `NSEvent` keyDown monitor (`startToolHotkeys`/
      `stopToolHotkeys`/`handleToolHotkey`, via `MainActor.assumeIsolated`): bare `Option+1…9` → launch
      favorite N; swallows only matched chords, passes everything else to the prompt field. Torn down in
      `stopDismissMonitors` and on any non-chips stage.
- [x] **Build green** — `xcodebuild … Debug` → BUILD SUCCEEDED.
- [x] Updated `docs/VISION.md` Pillar 1 status + `CLAUDE.md` (new store/view + local-monitor pattern).
- [ ] **Owner manual-test owed:** drop file → row shows favorites → click opens in app; `⌥2` opens the
      2nd; multi-file drop opens all; empty-favorites shows the hint; verify `⌥N` doesn't eat prompt keys.
- [ ] Capture a lesson if the hotkey monitor / focus interaction bites during manual test.

**Explicitly NOT in this MVP** (later pillars): file utilities (convert/compress), AI→tool bridges,
destinations (Slack/Notion), saved workflows, auto-detecting installed apps. Keep it thin.

## Feature — Lower deployment target macOS 26 → 14 (PLANNED — awaiting go-ahead)

> 2026-06-01. Owner wants older-OS reach. Chose **macOS 14 (Sonoma)** target (not 13 — 13 would force
> rewriting the 4 animated SF Symbols; 14 keeps them). **No older-OS test machine** → the 14/15 branch
> ships runtime-UNVERIFIED; the macOS-26 path stays byte-identical and IS verified on the dev machine.
> Good news: the glass look is custom (`NSVisualEffectView` + gradients), NOT the 26-only `glassEffect`
> API → the whole aesthetic survives untouched.

**The one real blocker — mic permission (per lessons MIC-01/04/05):**
- macOS **14/15**: audio TCC is owned by `AVAudioApplication`; `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus`
  returns a false `.denied` (MIC-04). → must use `AVAudioApplication.shared.recordPermission` +
  `AVAudioApplication.requestRecordPermission`.
- macOS **26**: reversed — `AVAudioApplication` defaults `.denied` for accessory apps; `AVCaptureDevice`
  maps to `kTCCServiceMicrophone` correctly (MIC-05). → keep the current `AVCaptureDevice` path.
- Current code = AVCaptureDevice ONLY → dictation would break on 14/15. Fix = `if #available(macOS 26, *)`
  split, restoring the documented MIC-04 path behind the guard.

**Plan:** (code DONE 2026-06-01 — build green; owner runtime-test owed)
- [x] Set `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 14.0` — done at the **project level** (pbxproj lines 300/358);
      neither target overrides it, so app + AddToAIDrop both inherit 14. No `LSMinimumSystemVersion` present.
- [x] Built target 14 against the 26 SDK → **ZERO availability errors**. No 26-only APIs in the code
      (Liquid Glass is custom; `.symbolEffect`×4 are 14+). So **no `#available` guards needed anywhere**.
- [x] **`SpeechRecognizer` Step 2 OS-split** added: `micAuthStatus()` / `requestMicAccess()` branch on
      `if #available(macOS 26, *)` — 26 → AVCaptureDevice (unchanged); 14/15 → AVAudioApplication (MIC-04).
      MIC-06 overlay-level drop kept in the shared path. 26 behavior byte-identical.
- [x] Info.plist mic/speech usage strings already present (`INFOPLIST_KEY_NS*UsageDescription`, pbxproj
      both configs) — no change needed.
- [x] **Clean build green** at target 14 (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- [x] README `macOS 13+` → `macOS 14+`; CLAUDE.md deployment-target + known-gaps updated; lesson MIC-11 added.
- [ ] **OWNER — verify the 26 runtime path unchanged on THIS machine:** drag→drop→action + dictation
      (mic prompt + transcription). Should be identical to before (26 branch untouched).
- [ ] **OWNER, when you get a 14/15 box/VM:** verify dictation actually prompts + records there. Until
      then the 14/15 mic branch is code-reviewed but NOT runtime-proven (the #1 residual risk).

---

## Feature — Spend instrumentation (§8) (code DONE — NEEDS deploy + secret + table)

> 2026-06-01. Owner priority is the API bill; this gives eyes on it. We already capture real
> tokens per call — this rolls them up so you can see spend and tune routing on data, not vibes.
> Server-side only, no app release. Per-action breakdown deferred (needs the client to send the
> action name; today only `tier` is sent).

- [x] **`spend` table** (`schema.sql`): per day × model-billed × requested-tier, splitting
      `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` so cost is estimable. `PRIMARY KEY(day, model, tier)`.
- [x] **Worker writes it best-effort** after each successful call (`index.js`, `.catch(()=>{})` so a
      logging failure never breaks a user response). Tracks `usedModel` (incl. the fallback model),
      normalizes the tier hint to `fast|strong|extra|other`. `callGemini` now returns split in/out tokens.
- [x] **Spend write is OFF the response path** — wrapped in `ctx.waitUntil()` so it runs *after* the
      response is sent (zero user-facing latency). `handleComplete(request, env, ctx)`. Falls back to a
      plain `await` if `ctx` is missing. The consume/global-usage writes stay awaited (they gate the next
      request's limits → must be race-free).
- [x] **`GET /v1/stats`** — admin-guarded by the `ADMIN_TOKEN` secret (unset ⇒ endpoint closed).
      `?days=N` (default 7, max 90). Returns per-row + totals with `est_usd` from a list-price map
      (flash-lite/flash/pro; unknown model ⇒ $0). Cost math verified offline.
- [x] `node --check` clean. Cost/reduce logic sanity-checked (164-call sample ≈ $0.41).
- [ ] **USER ACTION 1:** `wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN` (any long random string).
- [ ] **USER ACTION 2:** create the table — `wrangler d1 execute aidrop --remote --file=./schema.sql`
      (re-runs all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` — harmless to repeat).
- [ ] **USER ACTION 3:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy`.
- [ ] **Read it:** `curl -H "X-Admin-Token: <token>" https://aidrop.aidrop.workers.dev/v1/stats?days=7`
- [ ] FUTURE: send the action name from the client → per-action spend; optional simple HTML dashboard.

## Feature — 2× char caps + token-budget daily quota (code DONE — NEEDS deploy + D1 migration)

> Goal (owner): "double the max chars for free and paid users on every model; change the daily
> limit from flat interactions to 3× the maxchar for free and 10× for pro." Then, asked "is chars
> the right unit? we also have images" — owner chose to **meter actual upstream tokens** (chars
> miss image bytes). Priority unchanged: the operator's bill comes first; per-user cap is a relief valve.

- [x] **Doubled all char caps.** Client `FileContentExtractor.maxChars` 12k→**24k**, `maxCharsPro`
      24k→**48k**. Worker `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS` 20k→**40k**, `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS_PRO` 40k→**80k**
      (`wrangler.toml` + `readLimits` defaults). These now serve as the **pre-flight input guard**
      (char-based, checked before the call — token cost isn't known until after). Client cap stays
      below the Worker cap on purpose — headroom for the document riding every multi-turn request.
- [x] **Daily quota: flat interactions → TOKEN budget.** Was `FREE_DAILY_CAP = 10`/day. Now metered on
      the **actual tokens Gemini bills** (input + output), read from each response's `usage` block — so
      images, PDFs and text all debit fairly (a char count misses image bytes). `FREE_DAILY_TOKENS = 30000`
      (~3 full free requests), `PRO_DAILY_TOKENS = 200000` (~10 full pro requests). Tunable server-side,
      no app update. Fallback: if upstream `usage` is missing, estimate `chars/4` so nothing meters free.
- [x] **Trial unchanged (interaction-based, 30 lifetime); Pro bypasses the trial** → straight to its
      big daily token budget. Gate is "already-consumed ≥ budget" (last request may slightly overshoot —
      a relief valve, per-request char cap bounds the spill). Global circuit-breaker left interaction-based
      (coarse abuse valve).
- [x] **Schema:** `usage` gains a `tokens` column (kept `count` for instrumentation + the global breaker).
      Upsert bumps both; `callGemini` now returns `tokens` from the upstream `usage`. `worker/schema.sql` updated.
- [x] **Usage payload reshaped** (`/v1/complete` + `/v1/usage`): drops `dailyRemaining`/`remaining`, adds
      `dailyTokenBudget` + `dailyTokensRemaining` + `tier:"pro"`. Client `HostedUsage`/`UsageStore` mirror it;
      menu shows trial interactions ("8 free left") then a daily **percentage** ("73% free today") since
      raw token counts mean nothing to the user.
- [x] Build green (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`) + `node --check` OK.
- [ ] **USER ACTION 1:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy` (pushes the metering redesign + doubled caps).
- [x] **USER ACTION 2 (one-time, existing DB):**
      `ALTER TABLE usage ADD COLUMN tokens INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — APPLIED.
- [x] Manual test — PASS.
- [ ] FUTURE (spec §8): model-weighted cost-credits — a gemini-2.5-pro token costs ~4× a flash token;
      raw-token metering treats them equally. Fine for now (pro budget is large, `extra` fires rarely).

---

## Fix — Worker realigned to the multi-turn client + honors output ceilings (code DONE — NEEDS `wrangler deploy`)

> 2026-05-31. Found the live Worker (`worker/src/index.js`) still spoke the OLD single-shot contract
> (`content` string) while the app now sends multi-turn `messages` → every hosted call would 400. See
> lessons [WORK-01]. User chose "fix it + honor ceilings" (server-only; model routing deferred).

- [x] `/v1/complete` now reads `messages: [{role,content}]` (legacy `content` string still accepted),
      forwards the FULL conversation to Gemini (multi-turn), and bounds cost by total chars across turns.
- [x] Honors `body.max_tokens` (the per-action ceiling the app already sends) with Gemini thinking-headroom
      `max(requested + 1024, 2048)` + `reasoning_effort: low` — kills the server-side 2.5-Flash cut-off
      (a truncated answer = a wasted paid call + a retry = paying twice).
- [x] Image inlined into the first user turn (same shape as BYOK providers). `node --check` clean.
- [ ] **USER ACTION:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy` to push this live, then test the free tier end-to-end
      (set tier to non-BYOK, drop a file, run an action + a follow-up).
- [x] Model routing by tier — DONE in the block below (no longer deferred).

---

## Feature — Worker model routing by tier (#1 bill lever) (code DONE — NEEDS `wrangler deploy`)

> 2026-05-31. The labeled "#1 lever" from `docs/HOW_LLM_IS_CHOSEN.md` §4/§9. Route mechanical, bounded
> work to the cheap model and keep the capable model only where judgement matters — the single biggest
> cut to the operator's bill. Owner constraint: "I hate hardcoding keywords" → keywords must be
> NON-LOAD-BEARING; flash is the floor; we never *rely* on a keyword to decide quality.

- [x] App already ships `tier` (`plan.tier.rawValue`) on every `/v1/complete` call (HostedProvider).
- [x] `AIAction.routing`: deterministic `switch` (no keywords) maps each built-in chip's task class →
      `.fast` (extraction/short-summary/translate/rephrase/docstring/altText/OCR) or `.strong`
      (explain/findBugs/refactor/describeImage/freeform).
- [x] `RoutingPlan.forCustomPrompt`: floor = `.strong` (flash); keyword list may ONLY downgrade a short,
      obviously-trivial prompt to `.fast`. Delete the list → reverts to always-flash. Never escalates.
- [x] Worker `pickModel(env, tier)`: honours only an explicit `"fast"` → `GEMINI_MODEL_FAST`
      (gemini-2.5-flash-lite); missing/unknown/malformed → `GEMINI_MODEL` (gemini-2.5-flash). Tier is an
      UNTRUSTED hint — a bad tier degrades cost, never quality.
- [x] Worker retry: if the routed (cheap) model call fails, retry once on the strong default before
      erroring (`result.ok` check, `model !== strongModel`). User gets an answer, not a 502.
- [x] `wrangler.toml`: added `GEMINI_MODEL_FAST = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"`. `node --check` clean; app
      build green.
- [ ] **USER ACTION:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy` to push the model map live, then test: a mechanical
      action (e.g. translate, summariseShort) should run on flash-lite; a reasoning action (explainCode,
      findBugs) on flash. Both should still answer (retry + untrusted-hint fallback cover the failure modes).

---

## Feature — Third tier "extra strong" (Pro-only top model, used sparingly) (code DONE — NEEDS deploy)

> 2026-05-31. SUPERSEDES the earlier "better model per tier" idea (too loose — auto-paid every call).
> Owner: pro everyday experience = SAME fast/strong models as free (the win is the bigger char cap);
> `extra` (gemini-2.5-pro) is a reserve used "only when really necessary", two ways: a tiny keyword-free
> whitelist + a manual "Go deeper" button. Server-verified (`accounts.pro`, reuses `isPro`) — free can't
> reach it. Owner constraint honoured: no keyword hardcoding; floor stays flash.

- [x] Client `AITier` gains `.extraStrong` (rawValue `"extra"` — wire contract). `AIAction.routing`:
      `findBugs`/`refactor` → `.extraStrong` (deep code reasoning); `explainCode` stays `.strong`.
- [x] Manual escalation: `sendTurn(forceTier:regenerate:)` re-answers the last turn forced to
      `.extraStrong` (drops stale assistant reply, no new user bubble). `RoutingPlan.with(tier:)` helper.
- [x] UI: "sparkles" icon button in the result icon bar, gated `provider is HostedProvider &&
      EntitlementStore.isPremiumUnlocked` (Pro + hosted only — BYOK has a fixed model, can't escalate).
- [x] Worker `pickModel(env, tier, isPro)`: `fast→flash-lite`, `strong→flash`, `extra→GEMINI_MODEL_EXTRA`
      (Pro) / `strong` (free degrade). Unknown tier → strong. `GEMINI_MODEL_EXTRA` optional → flash.
- [x] `wrangler.toml`: replaced `GEMINI_MODEL_PRO`/`_FAST_PRO` with `GEMINI_MODEL_EXTRA = "gemini-2.5-pro"`.
      App build green; `node --check` clean.
- [ ] **USER ACTION:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy` (same deploy as the content-cap change).
- [ ] **COST CHECK:** gemini-2.5-pro ≈ 4× flash / 12–25× flash-lite per token. It fires only on the
      whitelist + manual button, but confirm the sub covers it; comment out `GEMINI_MODEL_EXTRA` to disable.
- [x] **Manual test (Pro):** mark device pro + make `isPremiumUnlocked` true → sparkles button appears in
      result; tapping it re-answers on pro. findBugs/refactor auto-use pro; everything else stays flash.
- [ ] NOT changed: output-token ceilings shared across tiers; PDF 20-page cap shared.

---

## Feature — Pro tier content cap (2× chars for subscribers) (code DONE — NEEDS deploy + D1 migration)

> 2026-05-31. Pro/subscribers read twice as much of a file before the "analysed the first part only"
> truncation. Client free `maxChars = 12_000` → pro `maxCharsPro = 24_000`; Worker free
> `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS = 20000` → pro `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS_PRO = 40000`. Trust model: **server-verified**
> (`accounts.pro`), chosen over trusting a client hint — a modified client must not be able to double
> its own input spend.

- [x] Client `FileContentExtractor`: added `maxCharsPro`; `extract(from:limit:)` + `capped(_:limit:)`
      now take a cap. `buildMultiFileContent(…, charLimit:)` resolves it from
      `EntitlementStore.isPremiumUnlocked` (false today → free cap; flips to 24k when Pro unlocks).
- [x] Worker `wrangler.toml`: `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS` / `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS_PRO` vars (tunable, no deploy to change).
- [x] Worker `index.js`: `readLimits` reads both; `isProDevice(env, deviceId)` reads `accounts.pro`
      (server-trusted, try/catch-safe before migration, defaults free); content-size 413 uses the per-tier cap.
- [x] `schema.sql`: `accounts.pro` column for fresh DBs + ALTER migration comment for the live DB.
      App build green; `node --check` clean.
- [ ] **USER ACTION 1:** `cd worker && wrangler deploy`.
- [x] **USER ACTION 2 (one-time, existing DB):**
      `ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN pro INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — APPLIED.
- [ ] **To test the 40k path:** mark your device pro —
      `wrangler d1 execute aidrop --remote --command "UPDATE accounts SET pro=1 WHERE device_id='<id>'"` —
      and (client side) the 24k cap only activates once `EntitlementStore.isPremiumUnlocked` returns true.
- [ ] NOT changed: PDF 20-page cap is shared across tiers (only char caps differ, per request).

---

## Feature — Prompt caching of the document prefix (DONE — build green)

> Plan + impl 2026-05-31. `docs/HOW_LLM_IS_CHOSEN.md` §6 item 1 — "biggest real bill win after routing"
> for the multi-turn chat subset. We re-send the document every turn; cache it so follow-ups read it ~90%
> cheaper instead of paying full input price each time.

- [x] `ChatTurn` gains `cacheableDocument: String?` (defaulted) + `flattenedContent` (folds doc back into
      text byte-identically). `buildChatTurns` now puts the document on the FIRST user turn as that separate
      stable block instead of gluing it into the instruction string.
- [x] Anthropic: emits the doc as its own `{type:text, cache_control:{type:ephemeral}}` block, guarded by
      `cacheMinChars = 8000` (~Haiku's 2048-token cache minimum; below it the mark is a no-op).
- [x] OpenAI/Gemini: unchanged code — they auto-cache a stable leading prefix; `flattenedContent` keeps the
      first turn byte-identical across follow-ups so the prefix hits. Groq/Ollama: flatten only (no caching).
- [x] Hosted: folds doc via `flattenedContent` so the Worker still gets a stable cacheable prefix.
- Note: single-shot drops don't benefit (first turn pays ~25% cache-write premium, recovered on 1st follow-up).

---

## Feature — Per-action output ceilings / routing policy (DONE — build green)

> Plan + impl 2026-05-31. From `docs/HOW_LLM_IS_CHOSEN.md` (rewritten as an engineering spec).
> Owner priority: **minimise the operator's API bill first**; per-user caps are a relief valve.
> `max_tokens` is a CEILING not a target (you pay for tokens emitted), so this is a RUNAWAY
> GUARD, not the primary saving — the big levers (Worker model routing, prompt caching) come later.

- [x] New `AI/ModelRouting.swift`: `AITier{fast,strong}`, `AITaskClass`, `RoutingPlan{tier,
      taskClass,maxOutputTokens}`, `AIAction.routing` (static per-action plan), and
      `RoutingPlan.forCustomPrompt(_:)` (deterministic keyword/length heuristic, prompt text only,
      escalates typed prompts to `.strong` on evaluation/judgement signals).
- [x] Ceilings: tight for bounded output (summariseShort/altText 120; extract*/bullets 512),
      generous ~4096 where output ≈ input (translate*/rephrase*/addDocstring, OCR), mid for
      explain/findBugs/refactor 1024, freeform 1536, evaluation 2048.
- [x] `AIProvider.reply` → `reply(messages:imageURL:maxOutputTokens:)`; all 6 providers replace the
      hardcoded `4096`. Gemini keeps thinking headroom: `max(maxOutputTokens + 1024, 2048)` +
      `reasoning_effort: low`. Hosted forwards `max_tokens` so the Worker can cap the host model.
- [x] `sendTurn` computes the plan (`forCustomPrompt` for typed prompts, else `action.routing`) and
      passes `plan.maxOutputTokens`.
- [x] Fixed extension/app version mismatch warning (AddToAIDrop MARKETING_VERSION 1.0 → 0.9.8).
- [ ] NOT done (future, by ROI): Worker model routing (biggest lever, needs Worker live), prompt
      caching of the document prefix, image-only input trimming, validated escalation for extraction,
      usage instrumentation in normalised cost-credits.

## Feature — Conversation redesign + Gemini cutoff fix (v0.9.9, DONE — build green, manual test pending)

> Plan 2026-05-31. Make the result window a real multi-turn chat instead of a single result
> that restarts on every follow-up. Plus fix Gemini 2.5 Flash replies being cut off.
> Design confirmed: Restart (↻) = clear chat, keep file (→ suggested actions). User prompts =
> right-aligned bubbles; AI = full-width Markdown.

**Root causes**
- No conversation state: every chip/prompt calls `provider.complete(action:content:imageURL:)`,
  which rebuilds `[system, user(file)]` and REPLACES the single `.result(text)`. Hence "restart"
  + file re-sent + no transcript.
- Gemini cutoff: `GeminiProvider` `max_tokens: 1024`. 2.5-Flash thinking tokens eat that budget via
  the OpenAI-compat endpoint → `finish_reason: length` (the trailing bare `*`). Not parsing, not
  input context (1M).

**Plan**
- [x] Model: added `ChatRole`, `ChatMessage { role, display, modelText }`, `BaseContext`. VM gets
      `@Published conversation`, `@Published isAwaitingReply`, `var baseContext` (extracted once;
      invalidated by `additionalFileURLs.didSet`). `restartConversation(url:)` clears it → chips.
- [x] Clear `conversation` + `baseContext` + `isAwaitingReply` in `setChips`, `restartConversation`,
      `reset()`. `MinimizedSnapshot` carries `conversation` + `baseContext`; minimize gated on
      `!isAwaitingReply`; `applySnapshot` restores baseContext AFTER additionalFileURLs (didSet order).
- [x] Provider protocol: replaced `complete(...)` with `reply(messages: [ChatTurn], imageURL:)`.
      All 6 providers updated. Shared `openAICompatMessages(_:imageURL:attachImage:)` inlines the image
      into the first user turn (Groq/Ollama text-only → attachImage:false; OpenAI/Gemini true).
      Anthropic/Hosted split system turns into their own field.
- [x] Token fix: `max_tokens` 4096 across providers; Gemini also `reasoning_effort: "low"`.
- [x] Orchestrator: file-scope `sendTurn(provider:fileURL:action:typedPrompt:)` + `buildChatTurns` +
      `applyStage` in OverlayView. Optimistic user bubble; first/back-nav turn → `.loading`→`.result`,
      in-result follow-ups stay `.result` + inline `isAwaitingReply` thinking row. Error keeps the
      transcript (assistant ⚠️ note) unless it's the first turn (→ `.error`).
- [x] Rewired all 4 run sites (ChipsColumnView + TwoColumnView, action + custom) to `sendTurn`;
      removed both per-view `setStage` helpers.
- [x] UI: transcript ScrollViewReader (ForEach conversation → `ChatBubble`: right capsule for `.user`,
      full-width `MarkdownText` for `.assistant`) + `ThinkingRow` + auto-scroll to bottom.
- [x] Buttons: ↻ → `restartConversation` ("New conversation"). ← back unchanged (no convo clear).
- [x] History reopen rebuilds the full transcript from `SessionRecord.turns` (user+assistant per turn).
- [x] Resize: `.result` height from whole-transcript length, clamped 380–600.
- [ ] Manual test: multi-turn append (no restart), Gemini full replies, ↻ clears + keeps file,
      reopen-from-history shows transcript, minimize/restore mid-conversation.

## Feature — Multi-file drop + Finder "Add to AI Drop" Quick Action (v0.9.10, IN PROGRESS)

> Plan 2026-05-31. Two asks: (1) dragging MULTIPLE files drops them ALL into one session;
> (2) a Finder right-click "Add to AI Drop" that pops Stage 2 with the selected file(s).
> Decisions: right-click = a real Finder **Quick Action** (separate Action Extension target,
> top-level menu item). Files dropped/added onto an ALREADY-OPEN session keep the existing
> add/replace prompt, made batch-aware ("Add N files").

### Part 1 — Multi-file drop (self-contained, no new target) — ✅ DONE (build green, manual test pending)
- [x] `DroppableHostingView`: `extractURLs(from:)` (plural) + `cachedDropURLs: [URL]`; register reads all.
- [x] VM: migrate `pendingSecondFileURL: URL?` → `@Published pendingDroppedURLs: [URL]`; update all
      read sites (`isEmpty`) + write sites (`[]`). Add `setChips(urls: [URL])` — first supported = primary,
      rest supported = additionals; route unsupported-only to `.error`.
- [x] `performDragOperation`: fresh drop of N files → `setChips(urls:)`; active session → set
      `pendingDroppedURLs` (filtered to supported) for the banner.
- [x] `SecondFilePromptBanner`: batch-aware (header "N files", "Add N files to session"); `addToSession`
      appends all; `startNewSession` → `setChips(urls:)` with all.
- [ ] Manual test: drag 3 files → one session w/ 3 pills; drop 2 onto open session → "Add 2 files".

### Part 2 — Finder Quick Action extension (NEW TARGET — created in Xcode ✅)
> A macOS Action Extension (No-UI) that is a Finder Quick Action. SEPARATE, sandboxed process,
> so it hands the selected file URLs to the (non-sandboxed, always-on) main app.
> **IPC pivot (2026-05-31):** dropped the App Group plan — App Groups need dev-portal registration that
> a free/personal team can't do, which would dead-end the feature. Instead use a **named NSPasteboard**
> (`com.wallbrecher.MacNotchAI.share`) for the payload + a **Darwin notification** ping
> (`com.wallbrecher.MacNotchAI.addFiles`). Needs ZERO capabilities — works on any signing tier.
- [x] Extension target **AddToAIDrop** created in Xcode (No-UI Action Extension, embedded in MacNotchAI).
      Files in `AddToAIDrop/`: `ActionRequestHandler.swift` (reads `inputItems` → file URLs → writes the
      named pasteboard → posts Darwin ping → `completeRequest`; `ShareHandoff` writer inlined so the
      target needs only this ONE source file), `Info.plist` (NSExtension `com.apple.services`, principal
      class `$(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).ActionRequestHandler`, role Editor, Finder preview keys, activation
      rule `NSExtensionActivationSupportsFileWithMaxCount=100`). Sandbox + user-selected read-only come
      from build settings `ENABLE_APP_SANDBOX=YES` / `ENABLE_USER_SELECTED_FILES=readonly` (no physical
      entitlements file needed — the prepared `.entitlements` was deleted as redundant). Menu title set
      via `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = "Add to AI Drop"`.
- [x] Main app side: `MacNotchAI/IPC/ShareInbox.swift` (`drain()` reads the named pasteboard);
      `AppDelegate.registerShareInboxObserver` (Darwin observer → posts `.addFilesFromShare`);
      `handleAddFilesFromShare` (drains + opens); `AppDelegate.openSessionWithFiles(_:)` (cancel dismiss →
      build/reuse window → `vm.setChips(urls:)` → size/place/order-front → `NSApp.activate`). Reuses the
      `restoreMinimizedSession` window bring-up pattern.
- [x] Full build green (main app + AddToAIDrop.appex compile, embed, codesign).
- [x] **Manual test:** run the app once (registers the extension with LaunchServices/pluginkit), then
      right-click file(s) in Finder ▸ **Quick Actions** (or the menu directly) ▸ **Add to AI Drop** → Stage 2
      pops with the selected file(s). If it doesn't appear: System Settings ▸ Login Items & Extensions ▸
      enable it under Finder/Quick Actions; `pkill Finder` (or re-login) refreshes the menu.

## ✅ Decision 0 — SETTLED: Path A (Developer ID + notarization)

**Chosen 2026-05-29: Path A.** Distribute as a notarized, signed direct download (NOT the Mac App
Store). Keep the entire architecture as-is — global `NSEvent` drag/keyboard monitoring + Accessibility
permission stay. This is what Raycast, CleanShot, Bartender, Rectangle Pro do.

What this decision means for the rest of the plan:
- **No App Sandbox** — the sandbox/MAS rejection risk is off the table. The core drag UX is preserved.
- **Payments = Paddle / Stripe / RevenueCat (NOT StoreKit).** External payment is allowed for
  direct-download apps, so the metering proxy + subscription can use any processor.
- **"App Store goal" → polished signed DMG + auto-update** (Sparkle later).
- **Deployment target** can be lowered freely (no MAS constraint) — still worth doing for audience
  reach (see review item: 26.0 → 14/15 with `@available` guards).

~~Path B — sandboxed MAS build~~ (rejected: would require re-architecting invocation away from global
drag detection; loses the "pill appears while you drag" UX).
~~Path C — both~~ (rejected: two codepaths to maintain).

---

## Phase 1 — UI polish (no backend, safe to start now)

### 1a. Calmer animations
- [ ] Reduce jelly wobble: `OverlayViewModel.stopJellyHover` dampingFraction 0.44 → ~0.8 (less
      oscillation), shrink hover scale 1.12 → ~1.05. Keep a subtle "alive" cue, drop the bounce.
- [ ] Soften entry spring in `OverlayView` (`scaleEffect`…`value: appeared`): dampingFraction
      0.58 → ~0.8; review the `handoffProviderName` fade-out spring (0.52) similarly.
- [ ] Audit the spring set across `OverlayView` for consistency; consider one shared "calm" spring
      constant instead of ~10 bespoke ones.
- [ ] Optional: respect **Reduce Motion** (`NSWorkspace.shared.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion`)
      — Apple reviewers and users expect this; swap springs for quick fades when on.

### 1b. Movable window (origin stays at the notch)
- [ ] Add a thin centered "grabber" line at the top of the card (collapsed → expands on hover/drag).
- [ ] Make the panel draggable from that handle only (`NSWindow.performDrag` or a drag gesture →
      `setFrameOrigin`). Do **not** enable `isMovableByWindowBackground` (would hijack file drags).
- [ ] Persist the manual offset for the session; **reset to the notch anchor** on each new drop so the
      default origin is unchanged. Note: `resizeOverlay`/`handleScreenParametersChanged` currently
      recompute origin from the notch every stage change — moving must coexist with that (store a
      user-offset and apply it after `notchFrame`).

---

## Phase 2 — Monetization backend (the real work)

The "cost is on me, first 30 free" model **cannot ship an embedded API key** — it would be extracted
from the bundle in minutes. This requires a metering proxy that holds the key server-side and enforces
quota there (the client counter is display-only and trivially reset by reinstall).

> **Plan written 2026-05-29. Core decisions settled (below). Paddle + the live proxy are deferred —
> the near-term work is client-side: lock premium in the UI behind placeholders we paste in later.**

### Decisions — settled 2026-05-29

- [x] **DECIDED: Proxy host → Cloudflare Worker + D1.** Serverless, global edge, ~free at our
      scale (100k req/day free), provider key as an encrypted Worker secret, no server to patch. State
      in **D1** (SQLite) for accounts + usage rows; **Durable Object** only if we need strictly atomic
      per-device counters. Alternative — a small VPS — means we own patching, TLS, uptime for no benefit
      at this scale. *Reason to confirm: picks the whole 2a toolchain (wrangler/D1 vs Docker/Postgres).*
- [x] **DECIDED: Identity → App Attest + DeviceCheck (anonymous free tier).**
      App Attest proves each request comes from a genuine, unmodified build of our app (blocks scripted
      key-draining). DeviceCheck's 2 persistent bits survive reinstall, so "free trial consumed" can't be
      reset by deleting the app. **Sign in with Apple is deferred to subscription time only** (paid users
      need a durable cross-device account; free users stay anonymous). *Reason to confirm: App Attest
      needs the `com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment` entitlement + key registration;
      adding SIWA up front would add a login wall to the free flow we may not want.*
- [x] **DECIDED: Payments → Paddle Billing — but SETUP DEFERRED.** Build the UI lock + API/config
      placeholders now; wire the real Paddle checkout later in a focused session. Paddle is a
      **Merchant of Record** — it handles global VAT/sales-tax registration and remittance, which a solo
      dev otherwise cannot do compliantly worldwide. Subscriptions + webhooks built in. RevenueCat is
      StoreKit-first; its non-IAP/Stripe path adds a vendor without removing the tax-compliance burden.
      *Reason to confirm: picks the webhook contract + checkout flow in 2c, and the MoR choice is hard to
      reverse once customers exist.*
- [x] **DECIDED: "30 free" = one-time trial of 30 hosted calls, then the free tier (10/day).** Server
      config holds `{ trialTotal: 30, freeDailyCap: 10, paidDailyCap: 20 }` so the numbers are tunable
      without a client release.

### 2.0 — DO NOW: lock premium in the UI + paste-later placeholders (no backend, no Paddle)

Goal: ship the Pro/premium surface *visibly locked* today, with all the wiring points stubbed so that
later we only paste in a proxy URL + Paddle URL and flip on the real checks. Nothing here makes a
network call — it's pure client scaffolding.

- [ ] **`BackendConfig` (Core/)** — one file holding the paste-later values, all `nil`/empty for now
      with clear `// TODO: paste after backend setup` markers:
      `proxyBaseURL: URL?`, `paddleCheckoutURL: URL?`, `appAttestKeyId: String?`.
      `var isBackendLive: Bool { proxyBaseURL != nil }` (false today → everything stays in BYOK mode).
- [ ] **`EntitlementStore` (Models/, `@MainActor ObservableObject`)** — the single source of truth for
      what's unlocked. `enum Tier { case byok, freeHosted, pro }`; `@Published var tier: Tier = .byok`;
      `var isPremiumUnlocked: Bool` (hard-coded `false` until backend is live). Stub methods that are
      safe no-ops today: `refreshEntitlement()` and `startUpgrade()` (the latter opens
      `paddleCheckoutURL` if set, else shows the "coming soon" state).
- [ ] **Two-version split in `OnboardingView`** — a top-level choice between the two ways to use the app:
      **AI Drop Free** (hosted, no key, metered — shown LOCKED / "Coming soon" until `isBackendLive`) and
      **Bring your own key** (the existing provider picker + key field — works today, default selection).
      Free is non-selectable while locked, so BYOK stays the only functional path = zero regression.
- [ ] **Locked "Pro" section in `MenuBarView`** — show the upgrade card with a lock badge, the planned
      perks ("hosted · no API key · more per day"), and a **disabled "Upgrade — coming soon"** button
      (enabled automatically once `isBackendLive`). Respects `uiScale` + `.liquidGlass`.
- [ ] **Build + verify** — app still launches in pure BYOK mode, Free/Pro show as locked/coming-soon,
      nothing attempts a network call. (No behaviour regression for existing BYOK users.)

> **Overlay limit-reached / upsell state is DEFERRED with the live backend** — it can't be reached until
> hosted metering exists, and the overlay stage machine is crash-sensitive (see Critical invariants).
> Build it alongside `HostedProvider` in 2b, not in this client-only slice.

### 2a. Proxy service (Cloudflare Worker)

- [ ] **Endpoints.**
      `POST /v1/complete` → `{ action, content, image?, requestedTier }` → forwards to the real model,
      returns `{ text, truncated, usage: { remaining, resetAt, tier } }`.
      `GET  /v1/usage` → `{ remaining, resetAt, tier, trialRemaining }` for launch sync.
      `POST /v1/attest/register` → one-time App Attest key registration (returns server account id).
      `POST /webhooks/paddle` → entitlement updates (signature-verified).
- [ ] **Auth.** App Attest: register the device key once (`/attest/register`), then send a per-request
      **assertion** the Worker verifies against Apple's root + the stored public key (replay-guarded by a
      monotonic counter). Issue a short-lived bearer (signed JWT, ~15 min) after a valid assertion so not
      every call re-verifies attestation. Bearer carries the opaque `accountId`.
- [ ] **Metering (server = source of truth).** D1 schema sketch:
      `accounts(id PK, deviceHash, createdAt, tier, trialUsed, subStatus, subExpiry, paddleCustomerId)`
      and `usage(accountId, day, count)`. On `/complete`: look up tier → cap, check `trialUsed`/today's
      `count`, **reject with 429 before forwarding** if over, else forward, then increment in the same
      transaction. Daily counter keyed by **UTC day**; client shows local-midnight reset (note skew).
- [ ] **Model routing by tier.** `free`/trial → **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (chosen by owner: cheapest + fast
      with fair reasoning; host key = `GEMINI_API_KEY` Worker secret). `paid` → a stronger model
      (Claude Haiku 4.5 / GPT-4o-mini — decide at build time). Keys held only as Worker secrets, never
      in the app bundle. Map our `AIAction` → server-side prompt templates so they're tunable without a
      client release.
- [ ] **Images (vision).** Accept base64 inline in `image` for files under ~4 MB (Worker body limits);
      reject larger with a clear error → client falls back to "too large for hosted, use BYOK/local".
      Forward as the provider's image part. **Never write image bytes to storage.**
- [ ] **Abuse + cost protection.** Per-account rate limit (e.g. burst 5/min) **and** a global daily spend
      circuit-breaker (hard stop if total calls exceed a budgeted ceiling, so a bug/abuse can't drain the
      account). Reject oversized `content` early (client already caps extraction at 12k chars — enforce
      server-side too). Log **only** counters + hashed device id + status codes — **no file content, no
      prompts, no completions** (this is the privacy commitment reviewers will ask about; see Security).
- [ ] **Secrets/ops.** Provider keys + Paddle webhook secret via `wrangler secret`. Staging vs prod
      Workers. App Attest in **development** env until release, then **production**.

### 2b. Client integration

- [ ] **`HostedProvider: AIProvider`** — new impl of `complete(action:content:imageURL:)` that POSTs to
      `/v1/complete` with the bearer token instead of calling a vendor. Lives in `AI/`. On HTTP 429 it
      throws a typed `HostedError.limitReached(tier:resetAt:)` so the UI can branch (vs a generic error).
- [ ] **`resolveProvider()` wiring** (`AppDelegate.swift`) — when `selectedProvider == .hosted` (new
      `AIProviderType` case) return `HostedProvider`; BYOK cases unchanged. BYOK path **never** touches
      the proxy (Phase 3: BYOK = Pro for free).
- [ ] **Attestation client** — small `AppAttestManager` (Core/): generate/persist the App Attest key in
      Keychain, register once, mint assertions, refresh the bearer. Gracefully degrade if App Attest is
      unavailable (older HW/VM) → fall back to "BYOK required" rather than crashing.
- [ ] **Usage model** — `UsageStore` (ObservableObject): mirror `{ remaining, resetAt, tier }` in
      UserDefaults for instant display; refresh from `/v1/usage` on launch and after every `/complete`
      response (the response already carries fresh `usage`). Server is source of truth; local mirror is
      only to avoid a blank bar on launch.

### 2c. Usage UI

- [ ] **Usage bar in `MenuBarView`** — top row: "X of 30 free left" (trial) / "X of 10 today" (free) /
      "Pro — 20/day" (paid), driven by `UsageStore`. Respects `uiScale` + `.liquidGlass` conventions.
- [ ] **Limit-reached overlay state** — new branch when `HostedError.limitReached` is thrown: a calm
      stage offering **Subscribe** (opens Paddle checkout in browser) and **Use my own key** (jumps to
      onboarding/settings BYOK). No dead end. Shows `resetAt` ("resets in 6h").

### 2d. Payments (Paddle — Path A, no StoreKit)

- [ ] **Checkout** — "Subscribe" opens a Paddle-hosted checkout URL in the default browser
      (external payment is permitted for direct-download apps; StoreKit not used).
- [ ] **Linking device → subscription** — free tier is anonymous, but a subscription needs a durable
      account. At checkout, collect email (Paddle does this); webhook stores `paddleCustomerId` +
      `subStatus` on a server account. The app links its device to that account via a one-time
      **license code** (issued post-purchase, pasted into Settings) **or** Sign in with Apple at
      subscribe time — pick during the **[CONFIRM]** identity decision above.
- [ ] **Entitlement** — `POST /webhooks/paddle` (signature-verified) updates `subStatus`/`subExpiry`;
      `/v1/usage` returns the resolved tier. Client caches entitlement locally for offline launch but
      **re-validates on every launch** (source of truth = proxy, fed by Paddle webhooks).

### 2e. Privacy / compliance follow-through (gates submission)

- [ ] Document exactly what the proxy logs/retains (counters + hashed id only; **no content**) — needed
      for the privacy nutrition label and user trust (we become the data processor for hosted calls).
- [ ] Update the in-app privacy disclosure + README: hosted calls route file content through our proxy
      to the model vendor; BYOK calls go direct to the user's chosen vendor.

---

## Phase 3 — Tier model (after Phase 2 lands)

Target tiers from the owner:
- [ ] **BYOK** → unlocks all Pro features for free (user pays their own vendor; we pay nothing).
- [ ] **Free (hosted)** → "weak models" only, **10/day** cap.
- [ ] **Subscription (~$1/mo)** → **20/day** cap, better models.
- [ ] Central entitlement resolver: `tier → {allowedModels, dailyCap}`; gate `complete()` on it.
- [ ] Daily counters reset at local midnight; enforced server-side for hosted tiers.

---

## Review — findings from a full read of the codebase

### Architecture (overall: strong)
- Clean single-source-of-truth (`OverlayViewModel`) + Combine resize loop. The crash-avoidance
  invariants are documented in `CLAUDE.md` and real — keep honoring them.
- **Refactor candidates:** `OverlayView.swift` is 1,557 lines — split per stage (Pill / Chips /
  TwoColumn / shared subviews) into separate files. `AppDelegate` (657 lines) mixes lifecycle, drag
  observation, window sizing, and dialogs — extract an `OverlayController`.
- `runAction`/`runCustomPrompt`/`setStage` are duplicated between `ChipsColumnView` and `TwoColumnView`
  — hoist into the view model.

### Battery efficiency (overall: fine, one always-on cost)
- The only persistent cost is the global `.leftMouseDragged` monitor. It does minimal work per event
  (changeCount compare + early return), so it's acceptable — but it fires on *every* mouse-drag
  system-wide. Verify in Instruments it's not waking the app excessively during long drags.
- ✅ Poll timers (`0.10s` drag poll, `0.05s` drag-out poll) only run *during* a drag — good, no idle drain.
- [ ] `prewarmSwiftUI` holds a hidden window 2s at launch — negligible, leave it.
- [ ] `VisualEffectBlur` uses `.active` + `isEmphasized` continuously while the overlay is visible
      (GPU compositing). Fine while open; confirm it's torn down on hide (it is — window orderOut).
- [ ] Consider pausing the global monitor while the pill is disabled ("Disable for…") to save the
      per-event cost entirely during pauses.

### Bugs / edge cases
- [x] **DOCX broken but advertised** — FIXED. `FileContentExtractor` now decodes DOCX/DOC/RTF via
      `NSAttributedString` (Cocoa text system reads Office Open XML natively, on the main actor). No
      third-party zip lib needed.
- [x] **Non-UTF-8 text/RTF** — FIXED. RTF now goes through the rich-text path; plain text/code uses an
      encoding-detecting read (`String(contentsOf:usedEncoding:)`) with Latin-1 + lossy UTF-8 fallback.
- [x] **Silent truncation** — FIXED. `extract` returns `(text, truncated)`; oversized sources (12k chars
      / 20 PDF pages) set `vm.contentTruncated`, which renders a "Large file — analysed the first part
      only" hint under the result.
- [x] **Hotkey gate unwired** — FIXED. `DragMonitor.handleDrag` now gates pill appearance on
      `HotkeyManager.shared.isHotkeyHeld()` (no-op when nothing is configured).
- [x] **Mic permission** — confirmed resolved on the current build (SpeechRecognizer uses
      `AVCaptureDevice` for status + request per lessons MIC-05; all MIC lessons are closed).
- [ ] **Deployment target 26.0 → 14/15 — DEFERRED (own task, needs multi-OS testing).** No
      macOS-26-only APIs are used in the UI, BUT the mic TCC logic is version-sensitive: the code uses
      `AVCaptureDevice` (correct on 26 per MIC-05) while MIC-04 says macOS 14/15 need `AVAudioApplication`.
      Lowering the target without `if #available(macOS 26, *)` branching risks breaking dictation on
      older OSes — and that can't be verified on this machine (macOS 26). Do this as a focused change
      with access to a 14/15 test machine or VM.

### Security / privacy (matters for App Store review)
- ✅ API keys in Keychain, not UserDefaults. ✅ Files read only on explicit action (no speculative upload).
- [ ] **Privacy nutrition label** required: the app reads user files and sends contents to third-party
      AI APIs. Must be disclosed accurately (data types, third parties) or Apple rejects.
- [ ] When the hosted proxy ships, document what the proxy logs/retains — reviewers will ask, and it's
      a genuine user-trust issue (you'd be the data processor).
- [ ] `HandoffManager` writes file contents + AI output to the general clipboard — fine, but worth a
      one-line disclosure.
- [ ] No `App Transport Security` exception needed (all vendor endpoints are HTTPS); the Ollama
      `http://localhost` path will need an ATS localhost exception if ever sandboxed.

### What an Apple reviewer will flag
1. **Sandbox** — see Decision 0. The #1 rejection risk for MAS.
2. **Accessibility permission usage** — must have a precise, honest purpose string; reviewers test that
   the app degrades gracefully if denied (right now drag detection just silently won't work).
3. **Purpose strings** — `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` / `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` must be
   present and specific (dictation in the prompt field).
4. **`LSUIElement` menu-bar app** — fine, but must have a visible way to quit + access settings (it does).
5. **Functional completeness** — broken DOCX / silent truncation could read as "doesn't work as
   advertised." Fix before submission.
6. **Deployment target macOS 26.0** — drastically limits the audience and looks like a misconfig.
   Lower to macOS 14/15 with `@available` guards for the broadest store reach.
7. **Payments** — if any paid feature exists in a MAS build, it must use StoreKit IAP (external payment
   links are restricted). This is another reason Decision 0 comes first.

---

## Suggested sequence
1. **Decide Path A / B / C** (Decision 0).
2. Phase 1 UI polish — independent, ships value immediately, no backend.
3. Fix the review bugs (DOCX, RTF/encoding, truncation hint, hotkey wiring, deployment target).
4. Phase 2 proxy + usage UI.
5. Phase 3 tiers + payments per chosen path.
6. Privacy labels, purpose strings, notarization/submission.

## Feature — Tabbed prompt section (Suggested / History / Custom)

> Confirmed scope (2026-05-30): **Stage 2 only** (the freshly-dropped-file chips card,
> `ChipsColumnView`). The stage-3 result view's "Suggested" rail is left untouched.
> **History records typed prompts only** (the free-text questions you run); tapping one re-runs it
> against the current file as a freeform query.

**Goal:** replace the single "Suggested" label + chip list in `ChipsColumnView` with a 3-tab switcher:
- **Suggested** — icon `sparkles.2` — current `FileInspector.suggestedActions(for:)` chips (default tab).
- **History** — icon `list.bullet` — auto-saved typed prompts, most-recent first, tap to re-run.
- **Custom** — icon `slider.vertical.3` — user-curated saved prompts + a `+` row to add inline.

Both History and Custom entries are plain strings; tapping either runs `runCustomPrompt`-style freeform.
History + Custom lists persist locally (UserDefaults string arrays). Custom prompts are also
managed in **Settings → Custom Prompts** (add / delete).

### Window-sizing approach (critical — fixed CGSize per stage)
The chips window height is computed in `AppDelegate.resizeOverlay` from the suggested-action count.
With tabs the visible row count changes per tab → the height must follow.
- Add `@Published var chipsTab` to the VM; `AppDelegate.observe…` subscribes to it (alongside
  `$isChipsExpanded`) and re-runs `resizeOverlay`.
- The tab content lives in a **capped** region: `min(rowCount, 5) × rowHeight`, internal `ScrollView`
  beyond that → window never grows unbounded, mirrors the result-card pattern.
- Empty tabs (e.g. Custom with 0 entries) render a fixed ~1-row placeholder so height is well-defined.
- Resize stays instant (`setFrame display:false`); tab-content swap animates with `easeInOut`/opacity
  (no spring → no Y-bounce, per ANIM-02).

### Steps
- [x] **`Models/PromptStore.swift` (new)** — `@MainActor final class PromptStore: ObservableObject`,
      `static let shared`. `@Published private(set) history: [String]` (cap 20, dedup, most-recent-first),
      `@Published private(set) customPrompts: [String]`. Persist via `UserDefaults` keys `prompt.history`,
      `prompt.custom` (native `[String]`). Methods: `recordHistory(_:)`, `addCustom(_:)`,
      `removeCustom(_:)`, `removeCustom(at:)`, `clearHistory()`. Auto-included via file-system-synced group.
- [x] **`OverlayViewModel`** — added `enum ChipsTab { suggested, history, custom }` +
      `@Published var chipsTab`. Reset to `.suggested` in `setChips()` and `reset()`. Added shared
      `ChipsLayout` geometry helper (rowStride/spacing/tabBarHeight + `contentHeight(rows:)` +
      `rows(for:suggested:history:custom:)`) so view + AppDelegate agree on height.
- [x] **`OverlayView` `ChipsColumnView`** — replaced `Text("Suggested") + chips` with `chipsTabBar`
      (3 icon buttons: sparkles.2 / list.bullet / slider.vertical.3, selected highlight) + `chipsTabContent`
      (fixed-height capped `ScrollView`). Suggested = `ActionChip` ForEach → `runAction`. History/Custom =
      ForEach over store strings → `runCustomPromptText`. Custom has inline `+` add row (auto-focused
      `TextField`). Tab swap on `.easeInOut(0.28)`.
- [x] **Factored `runCustomPromptText(_:)`** out of `runCustomPrompt()`; `recordHistory` called on every
      freeform run (typed or re-run, both stage-2 and stage-3 prompt fields).
- [x] **`AppDelegate`** — `observeChipsTab()` subscribes to `$chipsTab` + `PromptStore.$customPrompts` +
      `$history`; `.chips` case sizes height from the active tab's `ChipsLayout.rows(...)`, capped at 5.
- [x] **`SettingsView`** — "Custom Prompts" `Section`: lists `customPrompts` with per-row trash delete +
      add `TextField`/button. `@ObservedObject` the store.
- [x] **Build** — `BUILD SUCCEEDED`, no errors/unused warnings.
- [x] **`sparkles.2` SF Symbol verified present** (along with list.bullet / slider.vertical.3) via
      `NSImage(systemSymbolName:)` — renders fine, no blank-icon fallback needed.
- [x] **Manual test (user)**: drop a file → switch tabs (clean resize, no Y-jump) → run a typed prompt
      → it shows in History → add a Custom prompt via `+` and via Settings → both persist across relaunch
      → tap a History/Custom entry → re-runs.
- [ ] **Capture lesson** if any correction needed (esp. window-resize-on-tab-switch behaviour).

### Open/again-later
- Stage-3 result-view "Suggested" rail intentionally NOT tabbed (scope-limited). Revisit if wanted.
- Per-entry delete in the History tab (swipe/×) — out of scope unless requested; `clearHistory()` only.

## Feature — Minimize / restore overlay (v9.6)

**Goal:** A `−` button next to `×` minimizes the overlay (squish into notch, hide). Clicking the
menu-bar icon restores the minimized session. If nothing is minimized, the icon opens the menu as
normal (no empty overlay pops open).

**Design decision (confirm):** the menu-bar icon currently uses SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra`, which always
opens its menu on click — cannot intercept. To make a left-click *restore*, replace `MenuBarExtra`
with a custom `NSStatusItem` in `AppDelegate` whose button action is conditional:
- **left-click**: minimized session exists → restore; else → toggle the menu popover.
- **right-click**: always toggle the menu popover (so Settings/Quit stay reachable while minimized).
The menu content (`MenuBarView`) is hosted in an `NSPopover` (`.transient`). App stays a menu-bar
agent (`LSUIElement = YES`), `Settings` scene unchanged.

### Steps
- [x] **`OverlayViewModel`** — added `@Published var hasMinimizedSession`, `MinimizedSnapshot` struct +
      private `minimizedSnapshot`. `minimizeCurrentSession() -> Bool` (no-op at waitingForDrop),
      `consumeMinimizedSnapshot()`, `applySnapshot(_:)` (sets `stage` last). Snapshot cleared in
      `setChips()`; **preserved through `reset()`** so minimize→hideOverlay→reset keeps it.
- [x] **`MinimizeButton`** (OverlayView) — mirrors `CloseButton`, SF `minus`, neutral
      `.liquidGlassCircle`. Posts `.minimizeOverlay`. Placed before `CloseButton` in the stage-3 icon
      bar (always) and the chips/error header. **Gated to tag 1 (chips) + 4 (error)** — excluded from
      loading (2) so an in-flight request can't complete into a hidden, reset stage.
- [x] **`AppDelegate`** — `.minimizeOverlay` Notification + handler. `minimizeOverlay()` snapshots then
      reuses `hideOverlay()`. `restoreMinimizedSession()` builds/reuses window, `applySnapshot`, sizes
      via new `sizeForStage(_:)` (factored out of `resizeOverlay`), `place` + orderFront + monitors.
- [x] **Replaced `MenuBarExtra`** with `NSStatusItem` (sparkles template) + transient `NSPopover`
      hosting `MenuBarView`. `sendAction(on: [.leftMouseUp, .rightMouseUp])`; left→restore-or-menu,
      right/ctrl→menu. Popover rebuilt per open (fresh dynamic labels). `MacNotchAIApp` keeps only
      `Settings`.
- [x] **`MenuBarView`** — `openSettings()` → `NSApp.sendAction(Selector(("showSettingsWindow:")), …)`.
- [x] **Build** — `BUILD SUCCEEDED`, no errors/unused warnings.
- [x] **Manual test (user)**: minimize from chips/result → squish to notch, hides → drag a new file
      still pops the pill → click icon restores exact session (stage, tab, expand state, position) →
      with nothing minimized, icon opens the menu (no empty overlay) → right-click opens menu while
      minimized → Settings… opens from the popover.
- [x] **Lesson** captured (MENU-01): MenuBarExtra → NSStatusItem for conditional click; openSettings
      from an NSPopover.

## Feature — File tools (modify session documents) (v9.7)

**Goal:** Beyond AI actions, let the user *modify the actual files* held in the session. First cut
(chosen by owner): **Show in Finder · Rename · Move to… · PDF → .txt · Stitch PDFs · Image resize /
compress**. Media (video/audio) compression is a **later phase** (AVFoundation + optional
user-installed ffmpeg; FileInspector's unsupported gate must relax then).

**Constraints / decisions already settled:**
- **Pure Apple frameworks only.** FileManager (rename/move), `NSWorkspace.activateFileViewerSelecting`
  (reveal), `NSOpenPanel` (folder pick), PDFKit (text export + merge pages), ImageIO/CoreImage (resize
  + recompress). **No ffmpeg bundled** (size + GPL/LGPL + hardened-runtime signing). ffmpeg, when the
  media phase arrives, is *detected* if the user installed it (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`),
  never shipped.
- **Output policy: write next to the source** with a suffix + dedupe (`name-stitched.pdf`,
  `name.txt`, `name-1024.jpg`). Minimizes TCC prompts (non-sandboxed, but first writes to
  Desktop/Documents/Downloads can still prompt). Rename/Move are in-place moves of the original.
- **Session URL remap.** Rename/Move change the file's URL — the live session must follow it. Add
  `OverlayViewModel.remapSessionURL(from:to:)` to patch `stage`'s primary URL + `additionalFileURLs`
  (and the minimized snapshot if present).

### Open question for owner — UI surface (confirm before building)
Where do the file tools live? Proposed **A**; B/C are alternatives.
- **A (recommended): `•••` button on the file pill.** A small ellipsis-circle in `SingleFilePill` /
  `FilePill` opens a SwiftUI `Menu` of type-gated `FileTool` items. Per-file, discoverable, no new
  tab. Stitch PDFs appears only when ≥2 PDFs are in the session.
- **B: a 4th "Tools" tab** beside Suggested/History/Custom. More room for options but mixes
  file-mutation with AI-prompt UI and isn't per-file.
- **C: right-click `.contextMenu` on the pill.** Zero chrome, but undiscoverable on macOS.

### Steps (first cut)
- [x] **`Core/FileTools.swift`** (engine; static, throwing). Funcs: `revealInFinder(_ urls:)`,
      `rename(_ url:to:) -> URL` (extension preserved), `move(_ url:to folder:) -> URL`,
      `exportPDFText(_ url:) -> URL` (PDFKit page `.string` join), `stitchPDFs(_ urls:) -> URL`
      (new `PDFDocument` + `insert(page.copy(),at:)`), `resizeAndRecompressImage(_ url:,maxDimension:,
      quality:) -> URL` (`CGImageSource` thumbnail downscale → `CGImageDestination` JPEG), private
      `uniqueDestination(_:allowSame:)` (dedupe `-1`,`-2`). `FileToolError: LocalizedError`.
- [x] **`FileTool` enum + type-gating.** `static func tools(for:sessionFiles:) -> [FileTool]`:
      Reveal/Rename/Move always; +Export.txt and (Stitch when ≥2 session PDFs) for `.pdf`;
      +Resize/Compress for images. Each case → SF symbol + title.
- [x] **`UI/FileToolsMenu.swift`** — `FileToolsButton` (••• `Menu`, glass-circle default + `compact`
      dark-badge variant). Dialogs via **AppKit** (proven from the floating panel; SwiftUI `.alert`
      can fail to find a key window here): rename = `NSAlert` + `NSTextField`; move = `NSOpenPanel`
      (`canChooseDirectories`); image = `NSAlert` w/ `NSPopUpButton` size presets + `NSSlider`
      quality. **Errors = `NSAlert`.**
- [x] **Confirmation = native, not an in-app banner** (deviation from the draft — avoids overflowing
      `sizeForStage`'s fixed window height / fighting the resize loop): new outputs (pdf→txt, stitch,
      image) are **revealed in Finder**; rename updates the pill live via `remapSessionURL`; move
      remaps **and** reveals.
- [x] **`OverlayViewModel.remapSessionURL(from:to:)`** — patches the live stage (recomputing chip
      actions), `additionalFileURLs`, `cachedResult`, and the parked minimized snapshot.
- [x] **Wired into pills** — `SingleFilePill` (••• next to Share, always visible) and multi-file
      `FilePill` (compact ••• top-leading hover badge, mirroring the × badge).
- [x] **Errors** — guarded (missing file, unreadable/empty PDF, unreadable image, <2 PDFs, write
      failure); surfaced via `NSAlert`, no silent catch.
- [x] **Build** — `BUILD SUCCEEDED`.
- [x] **Manual test (user)** — reveal opens Finder w/ file selected; rename updates pill + session
      (AI action still targets the renamed file); move relocates + remaps; PDF→txt writes sibling
      `.txt` + Reveal works; stitch merges 2+ PDFs in pill order; image resize/compress writes smaller
      sibling; output dedupe doesn't clobber; banner + Reveal correct.
- [ ] **Lesson** — capture any TCC/PDFKit/ImageIO/remap gotchas in `tasks/lessons.md`.

### Deferred (not in first cut)
- [ ] **Erase Metadata** (EXIF/GPS strip for images via ImageIO; PDF `documentAttributes` scrub).
- [ ] **PDF → .md** (likely AI-assisted, not a pure extraction).
- [ ] **Media compress / change resolution** (`AVAssetExportSession`; optional installed-ffmpeg
      detection). Requires relaxing `FileInspector` unsupported-type gate for video/audio.

## Feature — Session history (last 10 sessions) (v9.8)

**Goal:** remember the last 10 sessions (file + full AI conversation) and list them in a
"Recent Sessions" submenu of the menu-bar dropdown, styled like the screenshot (file icon +
name + date rows, "Clear History" footer, ⌥ to remove one). Clicking a row **reopens the full
session** in the overlay (restore latest result, one-level back to the prior turn).

**Design decisions (confirmed):** reopen full session · store ALL turns / restore latest ·
menu-bar submenu (native NSMenu, matches screenshot).

- [x] **`Models/SessionHistoryStore.swift`** (new, `@MainActor` `ObservableObject` singleton)
  - `SessionTurn: Codable` = `{ actionRaw: String, promptTitle: String, resultText: String, date: Date }`
    (`promptTitle` = typed question for freeform, else the action's title).
  - `SessionRecord: Codable, Identifiable` = `{ id: UUID, primaryPath, additionalPaths: [String],
    turns: [SessionTurn], updatedAt: Date }` + derived `fileName` / `fileURL`.
  - `@Published private(set) var sessions: [SessionRecord]` (newest first, cap 10).
  - Persist to JSON at `Application Support/<bundleID>/session_history.json` (conversation text is
    too big for UserDefaults). Load on init; save after each mutation.
  - `beginSession(primary:)` — set a fresh `pendingSessionID` (no record persisted until 1st turn,
    so a dropped-but-unused file never clutters history).
  - `recordTurn(primary:additional:action:prompt:result:)` — locate/create the pending record,
    append the turn, refresh paths, bump `updatedAt`, move to front, trim to 10, save.
  - `remove(id:)` / `clear()`.
- [x] **Record turns** — hooked all four result sites (`ChipsColumnView` + `TwoColumnView`,
      `runAction` + `runCustomPrompt`): after the AI `text` is obtained, `recordTurn(...)`
      (prompt = typed text for freeform, nil otherwise). Errors are NOT recorded.
- [x] **Begin session** — `beginSession(primary:)` in `OverlayViewModel.setChips(url:)`; paths
      kept fresh on rename/move via `remapPath(from:to:)` in `remapSessionURL`. Reopen continues
      the same record via `resumeSession(id:)` so further actions append (no duplicate).
- [x] **Menu UI** (`AppDelegate.buildStatusMenu`) — "Recent Sessions" item with `.submenu`:
      each record = `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` (32px) + 2-line `attributedTitle`
      (name `labelColor` / `dd.MM.yy, HH:mm` `secondaryLabelColor` — adapts to light/dark).
      `representedObject` = record id; action `menuOpenHistorySession(_:)`. Per row an `isAlternate`
      ⌥ item (red "Remove …") → `menuRemoveHistorySession(_:)`. Footer: separator + "Clear History"
      (`menuClearHistory`) + disabled "Hold ⌥ to remove a single session". Empty → "No recent sessions".
- [x] **Reopen** (`AppDelegate.menuOpenHistorySession`) — builds a `MinimizedSnapshot`
      (`stage = .result(primary, lastAction, lastText)`, `cachedResult` = prior turn if any,
      `additionalFileURLs` = existing added files), injects via `vm.stageMinimized(_:)`, then
      calls `restoreMinimizedSession()`. Missing file → still shows the saved text (fallback).
- [x] **Build** — `BUILD SUCCEEDED`.
- [x] **Manual test (user)** — run actions on a file → session appears in submenu w/ icon + date;
      run a 2nd action → same session updates (not duplicated); new drop → new entry; >10 sessions
      trims oldest; click reopens overlay w/ latest result + back-arrow to prior; ⌥ shows per-row
      remove; Clear History empties; survives app relaunch.
- [ ] **Lesson** — capture any NSMenu attributedTitle/alternate-item or AppSupport-IO gotchas.

## Website — External file-type toggle for AI Drop hero (PLANNED)

**Goal:** move the mock Notch's internal file-type tabs out of the card and render them as a segmented
toggle above the AI Drop demo. The toggle labels use file extensions (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.md`, `.xlsx`);
selecting one changes the dropped file, caption/actions, and the mock Notch card height/content so the
window feels adapted to that file type.

- [x] **Data shape** — add a short `ext` label to each `pill.tabs[]` item in `website/data.js`.
- [x] **Markup** — add a `#fileTypeToggle` container above the `#sim` demo in `website/index.html`.
- [x] **Renderer/state** — in `website/app.js`, render the external toggle from `D.pill.tabs`, track the
      selected tab id, and make `renderCard()`, `renderTabRows()`, `setFile()`, and the intro fill
      sequence use that selected type instead of embedded card tabs.
- [x] **Remove internal tabs from the Notch mock** — keep the caption/actions inside the card, but no
      `.ph-tabs` row inside the pill.
- [x] **Responsive card sizing** — adjust CSS/JS so the expanded mock window height follows the active
      file type's action count while staying within sensible desktop/mobile bounds.
- [x] **Verify** — reload `http://localhost:4399/`, test all four toggles, desktop layout,
      mobile smoke, and console errors.

---

## Website — Logo orbit + idle autoplay for AI Drop hero (DONE)

**Goal:** replace the orbiting SF-symbol tool tiles with all app logos currently in
`website/assets/`, while keeping Scripts, scissors, and audio waveform as non-logo utility tiles with
distinct styling. Remove the Replay button. The AI Drop demo should automatically restart after a short
idle delay only when the pointer is not over the AI Drop demo/window area.

- [x] **Orbit data** — change `AIDROP.orbit` from plain icon names to typed items:
      `{type:"logo", logo, name}` for every suitable app logo in `assets/`, plus utility items for
      Scripts, scissors, and audio waveform.
- [x] **Orbit renderer** — update `buildChips()` in `website/app.js` to render logo tiles with `<img>`
      and utility tiles with `[data-icon]`, preserving the current orbit/fly-in choreography.
- [x] **Styling** — add visual variants for logo tiles and for the three utility tiles so Scripts,
      scissors, and waveform remain in the orbit but read differently from app logos.
- [x] **Remove Replay** — remove the Replay button from `website/index.html`, delete its click binding,
      and keep the caption aligned without it.
- [x] **Idle autoplay** — after the demo reaches `done`, schedule a replay after a delay; cancel while
      the pointer is over the AI Drop demo/window area and resume the idle timer after pointer leave.
- [x] **Verify** — hard reload the local site, check orbit assets render, idle replay pauses on hover,
      restarts after leave, no Replay button remains, mobile smoke, and console errors.

## Website — Logo orbit refinements (DONE)

**Goal:** keep the orbit feeling less sorted and less text-heavy: remove AI Drop / Pages / Preview from
the orbit, render the on-device utility tools as icon-only glass tiles, reshuffle the orbit order for
every replay, and keep hero text from replaying after the first boot-up.

- [x] **Orbit data** — remove AI Drop, Pages, and Preview from `website/data.js` orbit items.
- [x] **Utility tiles** — render Scripts, scissors, and audio waveform without visible text while keeping
      their tooltip labels.
- [x] **Glass styling** — make logo and utility orbit tiles share the same glass base; only tint differs.
- [x] **Replay shuffle** — randomize the orbit item order every `play()`/replay so the fly-in order is not
      visually sorted.
- [x] **Text replay** — keep the hero copy and boot captions from replaying after the initial boot-up.
- [x] **Verify** — syntax check, asset check, browser hard reload, confirm removed items, no visible utility
      labels, shuffled replay order, no text replay, and no console errors.

## Website — Demo actions + seeded rows (DONE)

**Goal:** make the AI Drop hero demo reflect the full action catalogue shown lower on the page, make
the Open-in row vary by selected file type, mark AI actions subtly with a sparkle at the right edge of
each row, and shuffle the demo rows with the same replay seed so the card does not feel sorted.

- [x] **Data mapping** — add fileType/category references for the four demo tabs and define per-tab Open-in
      app lists.
- [x] **Action source** — generate demo rows from `fileTypes[].does` plus the generic "Any file" actions.
- [x] **Seeded shuffle** — reuse the current replay seed to shuffle action rows and Open-in apps per replay.
- [x] **AI marker** — render AI rows with a subtle right-edge sparkle icon and style it unobtrusively.
- [x] **Sizing** — adjust mock card content height for the larger action catalogue without breaking mobile.
- [x] **Sizing correction** — keep the full action catalogue scrollable but cap the visible action area to
      about five rows so the AI Drop window returns to the prior compact height.
- [x] **Animation correction** — render the action catalogue as plain rows inside one animated
      `.ph-tabcontent` scrollbox, not as one `fill` animation per action.
- [x] **Bounded chip reveal** — animate only the first seven visible chips with a pop-in, then skip the
      remaining scrollbox rows and continue into the Open-in launcher animation.
- [x] **Prompt micro-animation** — type "Ask anything..." into the prompt after the launcher reveal, then
      pop in a blue mic button.
- [x] **ChatGPT icon + Pages launcher** — force the new `assets/chatgpt.png` to load in the website demo
      and add Apple Pages as an Open-in launch option.
- [x] **Legacy hero actions** — remove "Show in Finder" / "Open in a favorite app" from demo actions,
      restore the old backup hero options such as "Find trends" into the Notch demo.
- [x] **File groups section rewrite** — keep the hero demo unchanged, replace the file-type cards with
      Text / Media / Data technical groups, supported extensions, local actions, and a mixed AI prompt list.
- [x] **Remove Section 3 toggle** — show file groups directly and rename the demo file-type toggle labels
      from extensions to category names.
- [x] **Orbit acceleration timing** — delay the AI Drop hero tools' spin acceleration slightly while
      keeping the drop/fill choreography intact.
- [x] **Cursor file ghost styling** — make the dragged file proxy look more like a real macOS file while
      keeping it visually related to the dropped file badge inside the AI Drop window.
- [x] **Cursor file ghost frost + categories** — give the cursor-attached file the same frozen glass
      language as the orbit tools/window and tint/icon it by Text, Media, and Data category.
- [x] **Cursor file ghost flattening** — remove the colored tint/deep lighting from the cursor-attached
      file and keep only a flat frozen surface with a subtle liquid-glass stroke.
- [x] **Cursor file ghost icon clarity** — keep the flat neutral file ghost but restore clearly visible,
      distinct file-type icons for text, media, docs, and data.
- [x] **Cursor file ghost visible icons** — make the neutral file ghost icons visually obvious in the
      actual animation, not only technically present in the DOM.
- [x] **Cursor drag easing** — replace the linear cursor/file drag path with a smoother, more natural
      eased movement into the AI Drop pill.
- [x] **Revert cursor drag easing + soften icon** — restore the prior simple drag path and make the
      cursor-file icon stroke thinner with light alpha.
- [x] **Website demo video** — replace the Section 2 demo placeholder with the local
      `website/notch-demo.mp4` recording and verify it loads in the browser.
- [x] **Cursor/file vanish offset** — keep the AI Drop pill expansion timing unchanged, but make the
      cursor-attached file disappear 50ms later.
- [x] **Smoother pill morph** — make the waiting pill expand into the card with simultaneous width/height
      motion and a subtle liquid distortion, without changing the drag/fill choreography.
- [x] **Earlier morph/vanish timing** — start the smoother pill morph and cursor/file vanish 100ms earlier,
      while leaving the rest of the hero choreography in place.
- [x] **Higher pill drop + longer drag** — make the waiting pill visibly enter from slightly higher up and
      lengthen the cursor/file drag movement without moving the drop/morph/fill beats.
- [x] **Earlier/slower pill drop** — start the waiting-pill drop animation earlier, extend its duration by
      the same amount, and keep the settled endpoint unchanged.
- [x] **Hero copy choreography** — keep "Your daily tools" visible from the start, reveal "one drag away"
      when the pill expands, and reveal the body copy at the existing final copy-reveal beat.
- [x] **Hero headline pop** — remove the comma, enlarge the AI Drop hero headline, and make "one drag
      away" pop in while "Your daily tools" shifts and shrinks slightly.
- [x] **Revert hero headline pop** — restore the previous hero-copy choreography styling: comma back,
      normal headline size, and no lead-shrink/tail-pop treatment.
- [x] **Verify** — syntax check, browser hard reload, all four toggles, row counts, app variation, seeded
      shuffle changes, AI markers, mobile smoke, and console errors.

## Website — loop number shine refinement (DONE 2026-07-05)

- [x] Keep the first boot-up count-up/popup choreography for the faster/stat numbers.
- [x] On idle replay, keep number values final and replay only a subtle shine/glow.
- [x] Cache-bust the touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

## Website — replay file-type rotation (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Rename the third hero demo toggle from the repeated Text label to Notes.
- [x] Advance the hero demo file type on every automatic replay: Text → Media → Notes → Data.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

## Website — file-type toggle liquid pill (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Replace the active toggle button background with a persistent moving selection pill.
- [x] Add a clean/snappy ease-in-out slide plus subtle liquid squash on file-type changes.
- [x] Recalculate the pill position on resize and cache-bust touched website assets.
- [x] Verify syntax and browser state.

## Website — auto toggle progress push (DONE 2026-07-06)

- [x] Add a subtle left-to-right progress light to the file-type toggle during the idle replay delay.
- [x] Correct the progress effect so it fills inside the active blue selection pill instead of sweeping across
      the whole toggle.
- [x] Make the thumb progress fill from the beginning of the idle delay and preserve/resume the current
      progress state while hovering the demo.
- [x] Move the automatic tab advance before the replay window fade so the selection pill visibly slides.
- [x] Use the same thumb push/squash impulse for automatic tab changes as for manual clicks.
- [x] Cache-bust touched website assets and verify syntax/browser state.

## Safari/browser tab drop fallback (DONE 2026-07-10)

**Goal:** allow Safari and browser tabs to hover and open a Dragaway session even when the browser's
drag session never discovers the notch window that appears after the drag has already started. Keep
the normal `NSDraggingDestination` path authoritative for Finder and every source that already works.

- [x] **Fallback capture** — cache a browser drag's HTTP(S) URL from the global drag pasteboard when
      `DragMonitor` first recognizes the session; do not write a Drops file until a confirmed release.
- [x] **Fallback hover** — while AppKit has not entered `DroppableHostingView`, derive hover from the
      global mouse position and the visible pill's real screen-space target rectangle.
- [x] **Fallback commit** — on physical mouse release over the pill, materialize the cached URL and
      open/add it through the existing session flow; disarm when AppKit takes ownership so one gesture
      can never produce two drops.
- [x] **Lifecycle safety** — clear fallback state on exit/cancel/space changes and preserve the existing
      pasteboard stale guards, deferred stage transitions, window reuse, and Finder behavior.
- [x] **Verify** — build Debug; retain Finder's proven `draggingEntered` path; exercise repeated real
      Safari-tab drags through fallback hover/drop; confirm the materialized page file, enriched content,
      and live chips-stage window; inspect cancel/duplicate-drop guards and pass `git diff --check`.

## Browser image vs URL drag routing (PLANNED 2026-07-12)

**Goal:** materialize the thing the user visibly dragged. Browser image-result drags that expose both
bitmap data and a source/page URL must become image files, while Safari/browser tab and link drags must
keep the proven URL fallback unchanged.

- [x] **Central payload priority** — make bitmap bytes authoritative over URL/text and support PNG,
      TIFF, and JPEG pasteboard flavours through one shared classifier.
- [x] **AppKit destination path** — remove the URL-first short circuit in `draggingEntered`; cache image
      data first, fall back to an image file promise when bytes are declared but unavailable, then URL/text.
- [x] **Late-window fallback path** — cache a typed image-or-URL payload instead of only `fallbackWebURL`,
      while preserving the existing geometry, physical mouse-up commit, AppKit ownership handoff,
      stale-pasteboard guards, and one-drop-only behavior.
- [x] **Verify build and static routing** — Debug build succeeds, `git diff --check` passes, and the
      image-first/AppKit/fallback ownership paths were inspected against the existing guards.
- [x] **Verify real interactions** — user-verified Google Images → PNG, Safari tab/link → TXT,
      Finder file → normal AppKit drop, cancel/outside release, and repeated mixed drags, including
      the resulting outputs and diagnostic routing.
- [x] **Capture lesson** — document the mixed-pasteboard priority rule after the correction is verified.

## Optional Accessibility access + Clipboard History paste-on-pick (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-13; manual smoke pending)

**Goal:** keep Dragaway fully useful without permissions while offering an explicit, default-off
Accessibility upgrade. Without the opt-in, choosing a Clipboard History item copies it and returns
focus to the previously active app so the user only needs to press ⌘V. With the opt-in *and* granted
macOS event-posting access, the same choice pastes immediately. Never request permission at launch.

- [x] **Central capability gate** — add one small shared helper for the persisted opt-in (default
      `false`), `CGPreflightPostEventAccess()`, `CGRequestPostEventAccess()`, opening the Accessibility
      Privacy pane, and posting exactly one Command-V shortcut. Runtime use must always require both
      the user's opt-in and current system authorization; do not inspect the AX/UI tree.
- [x] **Settings UX** — add a discoverable `Enhanced Access` settings section and status-menu entry.
      Use a `Make Dragaway more powerful` toggle, show the live macOS permission state, offer an
      `Open System Settings` action when required, and list only the capability that exists today:
      immediate paste of selected Clipboard History text, images, or files into the previously active
      app. Explain that switching the feature off stops Dragaway from using access but cannot revoke
      the macOS grant itself.
- [x] **Request only on intent** — call the system request only on the toggle's OFF→ON transition.
      Keep the opt-in visible when approval is pending/denied, refresh authorization when Settings
      appears and when Dragaway becomes active again, and degrade to permission-free behavior if the
      user later revokes access.
- [x] **Remember and restore focus** — before the picker activates Dragaway, retain the external
      `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication`. After a real item selection, copy the item, dismiss the
      picker, and cooperatively return activation using the macOS 14 APIs (`yieldActivation` /
      `activate(from:options:)`). If the app quit or activation fails, leave the item copied and do
      nothing destructive. Esc / a second ⌃⌘V should also return focus without pasting; an outside
      click, ⌘Tab, or ordinary focus change must not reactivate the old app and fight the user's choice.
- [x] **Conditional paste-on-pick** — only after the remembered app is confirmed frontmost, post one
      Command-V when opt-in + TCC authorization are both true. Disabled, denied, or revoked access
      must stop before event creation and leave the user at the restored target app for a manual ⌘V.
      Use a one-shot selection token plus a bounded activation-notification wait so a timeout and an
      activation callback cannot double-paste, and re-check the exact frontmost process immediately
      before posting. Make pasteboard write-back report success and never auto-paste an empty/missing
      image or file payload. Selection by click and by number key share this path; cancellation must
      never paste. Keep menu-bar Clipboard History rows copy-only in this first patch.
- [x] **Truthful privacy documentation** — update comments and repository guidance that currently say
      Dragaway never requests permissions / never synthesizes keys. Document the precise default-off
      exception without weakening the no-Accessibility invariant for drag detection, hotkeys, Esc,
      or any other feature.
- [x] **Verify build + static safety** — two clean Debug builds; `git diff --check`; review the one-shot
      activation token, exact-PID and live-TCC gates, failed-payload path, modal-alert focus handoff,
      and passive-vs-explicit dismissal paths.
- [ ] **Verify real interactions** — manually cover: first launch/default-off
      produces no prompt; disabled selection restores focus and waits for the user's ⌘V; first enable
      requests access; denied/pending state falls back cleanly; granted state immediately pastes text,
      image, and file entries in representative compatible apps; permission revoked while enabled
      falls back cleanly; click and digit selection paste once; Esc/outside selection paste nothing;
      Clipboard History ordering and `ignoreChangeCount` still prevent duplicate captures.

## Apple Mail message drops (`.eml`) (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-13; manual drag smoke pending)

**Evidence/root cause:** Apple Mail already entered `DroppableHostingView` and wrote complete `.eml`
files into Dragaway's `Drops` directory. `.eml` was *not* removed as unsupported: the generic default
action pool already made it pass `FileInspector.isUnsupportedFileType`. The silent failure was later in
the legacy promise handoff — the session depended entirely on a successful receiver callback, although
Mail can leave the promised file behind without a usable callback. The recovery is therefore gated only
on `com.apple.mail.PasteboardTypeMessageTransfer`; DragMonitor, hover geometry, browser fallback
ownership, and the existing Safari/image promise path stay unchanged.

- [x] **Recognise mail documents + smart labels** — give `.eml` / `.emlx` the dedicated six-action
      pool `Summarise Email`, `What Do I Need to Do?`, `Deadlines & Risks`, `Draft Email Reply`,
      `Questions to Answer`, and `Extract Names & Contacts`, with mail-specific prompts and routing.
      Classify mail as prose so the existing non-English translation heuristic still applies, but do
      not add MIME containers to line-editing file utilities that could corrupt them.
- [x] **Mail-only promise recovery** — remember the exact Mail pasteboard flavour, preserve the normal
      Safari/image callback path, and handle Mail's one-receiver/many-callback legacy shape separately.
      Coalesce callback and recovered URLs in one multi-message batch; independently poll only the
      receiver's expected filenames for a bounded ~6-second recovery window. Accept only new-or-changed
      files whose size/mtime fingerprint is stable across two observations, that are regular, non-empty
      `.eml` / `.emlx` files passing a bounded MIME parse, and deliver them exactly once. Hold session
      handoff outside the overlay's live collapse interval so delayed callbacks cannot open hidden chips.
- [x] **Local bounded MIME extraction** — add a pure-Foundation RFC-822/MIME reader in
      `FileContentExtractor`: unfold headers, decode common RFC-2047 header words, prefer a non-attachment
      `text/plain` part, fall back to `text/html` converted by a no-I/O Foundation text pass, and decode base64 /
      quoted-printable plus common UTF-8/Latin-1/Windows-1252 charsets. Ignore binary attachments and
      bound input/output so a large attached file cannot become AI context.
- [x] **Useful AI context** — emit Subject / From / To / Cc / Date plus the cleaned message body, then
      reuse the existing character cap/truncation signal and email heuristics so suggestions and model
      input contain the message rather than raw MIME boundaries or attachment bytes.
- [x] **Static/extraction verification** — Debug build succeeds; standalone parser typecheck succeeds;
      a real dropped Mail message extracts decoded headers + plain body; a synthetic HTML-only message
      decodes its RFC-2047 subject and quoted-printable HTML while excluding a text attachment. A local
      HTTP trap receives zero requests from remote stylesheet/image URLs embedded in that HTML.
- [ ] **Manual drag regression smoke** — run the new Debug app and exercise: single Mail message →
      `.eml` session + six mail labels; repeated and multi-message drops; then Finder, Safari tab/link,
      and browser-image drops to confirm their existing routing remains unchanged.

### Correction — Apple Mail inbox-row legacy promises (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-14; FAILED OWNER SMOKE)

**New evidence:** dragging a complete message row from Apple Mail reaches `draggingEntered` and
`performDragOperation`, so the pill/destination is accepting the drop. Mail advertises both the modern
promise types and legacy `Apple files promise pasteboard type`, but `NSFilePromiseReceiver` never writes
the expected `.eml` and eventually reports `NSURLErrorDomain -1001`. Recovery therefore has no file to
recover. The missing step is invoking Mail's advertised legacy fulfilment API during the live drop.

- [x] **Invoke the Mail legacy promise at drop time** — only for the exact Mail message-transfer flavour,
      snapshot the destination before fulfilment, then call
      `NSDraggingInfo.namesOfPromisedFilesDropped(atDestination:)` inside `performDragOperation`.
- [x] **Reuse the hardened Mail recovery** — feed the returned filenames into the existing fingerprint,
      MIME-validation, multi-message batching, exact-once, and collapse-safe handoff path. Fall back to
      `NSFilePromiseReceiver` only if Mail returns no legacy filenames.
- [x] **Preserve proven paths** — leave Finder, Safari tab/link, Photos, and browser-image promise handling
      structurally unchanged; the legacy call must be impossible for non-Mail drags.
- [x] **Static verification** — Debug + Release builds and `git diff --check` succeed; the non-Mail receiver
      branch remains the original DispatchGroup/normalise/session-handoff route.
- [x] **Owner smoke test failed** — Mail wrote `.eml` files, but its returned promise label omitted the
      extension, so recovery watched a nonexistent extensionless path. See Correction 2 below.

### Correction 2 — Mail returns extensionless promise labels (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; single-message owner smoke passed)

**New evidence:** the legacy call now succeeds and Mail writes complete `.eml` files at the exact drop
timestamps, but its returned promise label has no extension. Recovery treated that label as the literal
destination filename, constructed an extensionless path, and therefore never saw the real `.eml` beside
it. This is now a deterministic receiver/recovery mapping bug, not hover or fulfilment.

- [x] For legacy Mail only, discover new-or-changed `.eml` / `.emlx` files by comparing the Drops
      directory against the pre-fulfilment fingerprint snapshot instead of trusting the returned label.
- [x] Preserve the returned label count as the expected multi-message batch size; require stable
      fingerprints, bounded MIME validation, exact-once delivery, and the existing collapse guard.
- [x] Leave modern Mail fallback and every non-Mail promise path unchanged.
- [x] Debug + Release builds and `git diff --check` succeed.
- [x] Owner confirms a single inbox-row drop is caught and its message content is extracted correctly.
- [ ] Owner re-tests several inbox rows, then Safari tab and browser-image regressions.

### Apple Mail drop perceived-latency fast path (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; owner smoke pending)

**Evidence/root cause:** the legacy Mail fulfilment call writes the real `.eml` before returning, but
the hardened recovery deliberately waits for two stable directory observations (currently about
0.65 s + 0.50 s) before opening the session. That safety delay, rather than MIME extraction, explains
the visible 1–2 second pause after release.

- [x] **Immediate Mail-only happy path** — directly after successful legacy fulfilment, compare the
      Drops directory with its pre-call snapshot and use newly written, regular, non-empty `.eml` /
      `.emlx` files to open the chips session without waiting for the recovery timer. Keep this path
      gated on the exact Apple Mail transfer flavour; do not change Finder, Safari, Photos, or generic
      browser-image routing.
- [x] **Collapse-safe early handoff** — make session opening cancel a pending overlay dismissal and
      explicitly revive a collapse that already began, so the immediate Mail handoff cannot create an
      invisible chips card during the existing mouse-up race. Preserve the token-guarded one-window
      lifecycle and deferred stage-write invariant.
- [x] **Prepare content off-main, naturally queue actions** — allow the mail chips to appear from the
      known file URLs while bounded MIME extraction runs asynchronously. Reuse the existing action
      pipeline's await-before-provider behavior so an unusually fast chip click waits for preparation;
      do not introduce a second explicit action queue or a new stage unless evidence requires it.
- [x] **Retain the hardened fallback** — if the immediate directory delta is incomplete or invalid,
      keep the current two-observation fingerprint, MIME-validation, multi-message batching, and
      exact-once recovery unchanged.
- [x] **Static verification** — Debug, clean arm64 Release, and x86_64 Release builds succeed;
      `git diff --check` passes. The
      fast path is reachable only from the exact legacy-Mail branch, partial batches still enter the
      old recovery, and delivered-path state stops the fallback from opening the same files twice.
- [ ] **Verify actual timing and regressions** — owner smoke for immediate single/multi-message feedback
      plus Safari tab, browser-image, Photos, and Finder drops.

### Correction — legacy Mail fast observation (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; owner smoke pending)

**Measured evidence:** the owner smoke still takes about 1.15 s. The latest DEBUG trace records the
legacy fulfilment returning in **6 ms**, but the synchronous directory delta is still empty. The first
recovery poll at 0.65 s sees one candidate and the second identical poll at 1.15 s marks it stable.
Mail is therefore fast; the recovery cadence now accounts for almost the entire visible delay.

- [x] **Accelerate only the proven legacy-Mail path** — after the empty synchronous scan, observe the
      private Drops-directory delta at a short bounded cadence (first check around 30–50 ms, then about
      every 50 ms). Keep the requirement for two identical size/mtime fingerprints, the advertised
      message count, MIME sanity validation, and exact-once delivery. Expected feedback: roughly
      100–200 ms when Mail writes normally instead of the fixed 1.15 s.
- [x] **Retain the slow safety net** — if no complete stable batch appears during the eager window,
      continue the existing conservative recovery through roughly six seconds. Do not change the
      modern promise route or Finder, Safari tab/link, Photos, and browser-image handling.
- [x] **Use the hardened early handoff** — once the eager observer validates the batch, open it through
      the existing collapse-cancelling session path rather than imposing the old 0.55 s callback-flush
      floor. Keep all stage writes deferred and the one-window lifecycle intact.
- [x] **Keep fake progress as optional Plan B** — intentionally not added yet. Only if the measured
      100–200 ms path still feels slow,
      keep the current pill visibly alive with a Mail-specific “Preparing email…” state while recovery
      runs. Do not add that state pre-emptively; it increases state/window blast radius without reducing
      the underlying latency.
- [ ] **Verify with timing evidence and regressions** — log fulfilment, first-seen, stable, and handoff
      elapsed times; Debug + Release arm64 builds and `git diff --check` pass. Owner still needs to
      exercise single/multi-message Mail and the existing Finder, Safari tab, browser-image, and Photos
      paths.

### Contextual Safari/Mail icons inside file pills (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; owner smoke pending)

**Scope:** presentation only. Files keep their real URL, extension, contents, Quick Look behavior,
drag-out behavior, and AI/file-tool routing. Finder metadata/icon assignment is explicitly out of scope.

- [x] **Persist web origin without changing TXT semantics** — attach a private Dragaway extended
      attribute only when `DropMaterializer` creates a `.txt` from an HTTP(S) URL, including normalized
      Safari `.webloc` promises and the late-window browser fallback. Reapply it after the atomic page
      enrichment rewrite; if metadata is unavailable or later stripped, fall back to the normal TXT icon.
- [x] **Centralize pill-icon presentation** — resolve `.eml` / `.emlx` to the installed Mail app icon,
      and marker-bearing web `.txt` files to the installed Safari app icon, with SF Symbol fallbacks.
      Every other file keeps the current `NSWorkspace` / Quick Look icon behavior.
- [x] **Limit the override to the chips file pills** — use the contextual resolver in both the single
      full-width pill and multi-file icon pills. Do not mutate the file's Finder icon, extension, UTI,
      content extraction, actions, session state, sharing, or drag/drop routing.
- [ ] **Verify presentation and regressions** — Debug + Release builds and `git diff --check`; manually
      compare a Safari tab, Mail `.eml`, Dragaway web link, native `.txt`, and ordinary files in single-
      and multi-file pills, including a web file after background enrichment/session reopen. Static
      verification passes: xattr round-trip, installed Safari/Mail bundle resolution, Debug build,
      Release build, and `git diff --check`.

### Two-row file header with contextual type label (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; owner smoke pending)

**Target layout:** row 1 = active primary-file type on the left and the existing header actions in a
tighter cluster on the right; row 2 = the file-pill region using the full available card width. This is
a layout/presentation change only; drop, session, Quick Look, drag-out, sharing, and action behavior stay
the same.

- [x] **Add one short contextual type label** — expose a display label from the existing presentation
      resolver: marker-bearing web TXT → `Safari Tab`, `.eml/.emlx` → `Mail`, `.pdf` → `PDF`, folder →
      `Folder`, and a concise extension/type fallback for ordinary files. Bind it to the current primary
      URL so multi-file promotion/removal updates it automatically; native TXT remains `TXT`.
- [x] **Split `FileHeaderView` into two rows** — top row uses the type label + spacer + a compact
      `4 × uiScale` action cluster containing the existing collapse, cached-result forward, minimize,
      and matched close controls. Preserve their current stage visibility, actions, transitions, and
      matched-geometry identity.
- [x] **Give the file row the full width** — render `FilePillsRow` underneath and stretch its container
      across the available width. Keep the persistent Share control inside the file pill at the far
      right for both single- and multi-file sessions; keep filenames, thumbnails/contextual icons,
      Quick Look, drag-out, carousel, removal, and multi-file per-item hover affordances intact.
- [x] **Keep AppKit window sizing in lock-step** — replace the hard-coded chips-header `50` budget with
      a shared two-row header-height constant and update expanded, collapsed, and media calculations.
      Apply the same measured delta to loading/error/result minimum sizing where the shared header also
      renders. Continue using instant `setFrame`, with no window-frame animation.
- [x] **Owner spacing refinement** — pull the lightweight type/control row eight scaled points upward
      and only its trailing edge into the card padding. The type remains aligned to the file pill's
      leading edge while the controls sit nearer the top-right corner; Share and file-pill layout stay
      unchanged.
- [x] **Show the active AI route** — place the currently selected provider and model beside the file
      type using the same hosted-vs-BYOK decision as request resolution. Keep fixed-model providers
      exact; describe Gemini's action-dependent Flash/Flash Lite routing truthfully, truncate at narrow
      widths, and expose the complete values in the hover help.
- [ ] **Verify every state and scale** — Debug + Release builds and `git diff --check`; manually inspect
      Safari Tab, Mail, PDF, native TXT, long filenames, single/multi-file carousel, all UI scales,
      collapsed/expanded chips, cached-result forward, loading/result/error, minimize, close, Share,
      Quick Look, drag-out, and primary-file promotion. Static verification passes: arm64 Debug +
      Release builds and `git diff --check`; the owner smoke remains.

### Header model switcher (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-15; owner smoke pending)

**Target:** the header reads `Filetype Model` with no separator or provider name. The model is a compact native
menu that changes the real request route, not a cosmetic label.

- [x] **Model-only trigger** — replace the provider/model caption with a plain clickable model label,
      retaining the filetype's layout priority, responsive truncation, `uiScale`, and current top-row
      alignment. Hosted Free displays exactly `Gemini 2.5`.
- [x] **Build the enabled-choice list from existing configuration** — include Hosted Free while the
      backend is available; include BYOK providers only when their existing Keychain service contains
      a non-empty key; retain Ollama when it is the active local choice without performing a blocking
      health request from the menu. Use friendly model names and provider names only inside the menu
      where they disambiguate equal model families.
- [x] **Switch the actual route** — choosing Hosted Gemini sets the entitlement tier to `.freeHosted`;
      choosing a configured BYOK model sets both `selectedProvider` and the tier to `.byok`. Mark the
      current choice with a checkmark and keep the header live through `@AppStorage` plus the observed
      entitlement store.
- [x] **Add `Provider Settings`** — put a divider and `Provider Settings` at the bottom of the menu,
      then route it through a dedicated NotificationCenter signal to
      `showSettings(section: .aiProvider)`, following the existing cross-component convention.
- [ ] **Verify** — static verification passes: `git diff --check` plus arm64 Debug and Release builds.
      Owner smoke remains: Free label, configured-provider filtering, checkmark, Free↔BYOK switching,
      actual next-request routing, settings opening, narrow header states, and all UI scales.

### Explicit BYOK model selection (IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-16; owner smoke pending)

**Scope:** no automatic BYOK routing. A user-selected provider/model pair is the exact route for the
next request. Dragaway Hosted Free keeps its existing server-owned `fast/strong/extra` cost policy;
direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and Ollama calls never silently replace the selected model.

- [x] **Central model catalogue + selection store** — add provider-neutral model descriptors, one
      persisted selection per provider, safe current defaults, and a 24-hour local cache. Fetch the
      account's live model list from each provider's official endpoint when Provider Settings opens
      or the user explicitly refreshes; Ollama lists locally installed models. A failed refresh keeps
      the last successful cache and never blocks an AI request or the pill.
- [x] **Curate live results without freezing versions** — intersect live availability with a small
      Dragaway compatibility layer (chat/text first, vision metadata where known), group known models
      cleanly, and retain unknown provider models under an explicit “Other available models” section
      instead of hiding new releases. Exclude obvious embedding/audio/image-generation/fine-tune
      entries from this text-completion picker.
- [x] **Execute the exact selected model** — inject the persisted model ID into every BYOK provider
      and remove Gemini's action-tier model switch on that path. Keep `RoutingPlan.maxOutputTokens`
      as an output safety guard, but make `tier` a hosted-only concern. If a selected model is no
      longer live, fail with a model-specific actionable error; do not silently use the default.
- [x] **Header + Provider Settings UI** — the compact header menu lists models belonging to all
      configured providers, marks the exact active provider/model, and can switch routes immediately.
      Provider Settings shows the selected provider's model picker, cached/loading/error state,
      last refresh, and a `Refresh Models` action. Hosted Free remains the single fixed
      `Gemini 2.5` choice.
- [x] **Lifecycle and trust** — preserve a selected-but-unavailable model visibly so the user can
      choose a replacement. Stable IDs are preferred; aliases/preview-looking IDs are labelled
      without automatic migration. Post one configuration-change signal so every open picker updates.
- [x] **Verify** — `git diff --check`, arm64 Debug, and arm64 Release pass. Static audit proves every
      BYOK request body receives the persisted exact model ID, every reply/stream image path applies
      the capability guard, Gemini discovery and execution share the OpenAI-compatible API surface,
      and Hosted Free is unchanged. Owner smoke remains: configure at least two BYOK keys, refresh
      each catalogue, switch provider/model from both Settings and the header, relaunch to confirm
      persistence, test offline cache, Ollama installed models, and an unavailable selection.

## Product page — replace viewport recordings (DONE 2026-07-13)

- [x] Replace all placeholder viewport sources with the named recordings from `assets/Recordings`.
- [x] Split chapter 1 into four video states: File, Safari tab, selections/search results, and result.
- [x] Update the GSAP video-index and progress-dot routing for seven total recordings.
- [x] Verify syntax, playback transitions, responsive layout, and browser console state.

## Product page — revert playback-aware scroll experiments (DONE 2026-07-13)

- [x] Remove duration-weighted dwell and playback-credit gate behavior.
- [x] Restore the linear scrubbed Stage timeline while preserving all seven recording mappings.
- [x] Preserve progress-dot navigation, reverse scroll, reduced motion, and normal outro release.
- [x] Verify syntax and the complete desktop/mobile scroll sequence in the browser.
- [x] Capture the interaction correction in `tasks/lessons.md`.

## Release v1.1.4 (DONE 2026-07-20)

**Scope:** ship the accumulated live-product work on `main` since v1.1.3. Keep `thesis` untouched.

- [x] Audit the complete `v1.1.3..main` plus working-tree delta and derive truthful release notes.
- [x] Bump the app and extension to marketing version 1.1.4 / build 7 and update the README headline.
- [x] Run diff checks and clean Debug + Release verification builds.
- [x] Build, Developer-ID sign, notarize, staple, and validate `Dragaway-1.1.4.dmg`; generate a signed Sparkle entry.
- [x] Commit the reviewed v1.1.4 source on `main`, tag `v1.1.4`, and push `main` plus the tag.
- [x] Publish the GitHub release with the notarized DMG and concise user-facing notes.
- [x] Commit and push the generated signed `appcast.xml`, then verify the public release asset and feed.

## Reliable website-content extraction (DONE 2026-07-22)

**Scope:** improve the text generated for Safari/browser URL drops on `main` without changing drag
detection, pasteboard routing, web-drop presentation, or the instant pill/chips transition. No paid
API and no Accessibility permission.

- [x] **Bounded static reader pass** — fetch the document once with `URLSession`, reject non-HTML and
      cap oversized responses, construct a DOM without loading remote resources, and extract structured
      article text plus title/metadata instead of stripping every HTML tag with regex.
- [x] **Rendered-page fallback** — when the static result is too thin, use an invisible, ephemeral
      `WKWebView` with navigation/popup guards, blocked images/media/fonts, a DOM-settle window, and a
      hard timeout. Prefer reader content; fall back to a cleaned `innerText` snapshot.
- [x] **Queue the first action safely** — keep the pill immediate, but let a chip tapped during web
      preparation await the same session/file-specific task before `FileContentExtractor` reads the
      generated TXT. Preserve multi-file sessions, stale-session rejection, URL-only fallback, and the
      existing mail-preparation path.
- [x] **Verify the implementation pipeline** — run `git diff --check`, Debug + Release builds, and focused local
      extraction smoke cases for a static article, a JavaScript-rendered article, a sparse/non-article
      page, a failed/slow URL, concurrent preparation, and rename while preparing. Static routing audit
      confirms browser-image, Mail, and native-TXT paths remain isolated; final physical drag smoke is
      left to the owner because the repository has no UI-test target.

## Folder drops and bounded folder understanding (PLANNED 2026-07-24)

**Scope:** make Finder folders first-class product drops on `main`. Keep the existing drag detector,
Safari/image/Mail routing, stage machine, and fixed window-size contract unchanged. Scan locally and
show exactly which children can enter AI context; perform only one normal provider request per action.

- [x] **One canonical bounded manifest** — add an off-main `FolderScanner` that recursively records
      relative paths and classifies every inspected entry as `included`, `eligibleButOmitted`, or
      `skipped(reason)`. Never follow symlinks or descend into packages, hidden/generated directories,
      dependency caches, or known secret/key files. Apply hard limits for depth, entry count, file size,
      elapsed scan time, and cancellation. Preview and parser must consume this same manifest.
- [x] **Explicit AI-content support** — do not reuse `isUnsupportedFileType` as the folder criterion:
      it intentionally treats media as droppable and gives unknown extensions generic actions. Define
      a strict bounded allowlist (PDF, Mail, text/code/data plus safely sniffed extensionless text).
      Keep DOC/DOCX/RTF supported as direct drops but visibly skip them during recursive preparation,
      because Cocoa's synchronous main-thread importer cannot be cancelled safely. Mark
      images/media/archives/installers/unknown binary and extraction failures visibly with a reason
      instead of decoding them as text.
- [x] **Instant session + shared preparation** — keep the folder URL itself as the session asset so
      Share, drag-out, Open-in, history, and local folder utilities continue to work. Show chips
      immediately, start one cancellable folder preparation in the background, and let a fast first AI
      action await that exact task before any provider is contacted. Re-scan on a restored session.
      Cap each session at four distinct recursive folder scans; keep later folders visible with an
      explicit local/provider omission marker instead of multiplying resource limits without bound.
- [x] **Trustworthy folder preview** — keep the existing full-width file pill and fixed chips geometry.
      Its subtitle shows `Scanning…` and then included/omitted/skipped counts. Clicking a folder opens
      a separate scrollable `FolderContentsPopover` with relative paths, text labels and symbols for
      each status, explicit skip reasons, scan-limit notices, filters, and per-file Quick Look. Do not
      add an inline tree or a new stage that changes `ChipsLayout` / `sizeForStage`.
- [x] **Single-call folder context** — build a deterministic context containing the bounded folder tree,
      coverage summary, and path-labelled extracted text. For small folders include every eligible file;
      for large folders enforce one global 24k/48k character budget and prioritise README/docs, project
      manifests, entry points, then representative small files. Surface exact coverage; never imply that
      omitted files were analysed. Add a folder-specific `What does this folder do?` action while keeping
      the custom prompt path available.
- [x] **Folder-safe surrounding features** — hide inapplicable file utilities such as SHA-256-on-folder,
      and withhold synchronous whole-folder ZIP until it has a true async path; use the folder itself
      as a script working directory, preserve multi-file/add-to-session semantics, and ensure no folder
      child is silently promoted into `sessionFileURLs` or session history.
- [ ] **Verification gate** — fixture-test nested supported/unsupported files, secret/hidden paths,
      symlink loops, packages, unreadable/oversized files, empty and huge folders, cancellation, restored
      sessions, global budget/coverage accounting, and a single provider invocation. Then run diff check,
      Debug + Release builds, and manually smoke Finder folder drop, preview, freeform
      `What does this folder do?`, Safari tab, browser image, Mail, and ordinary multi-file drops.
      Automated portion passed: real-extractor fixtures cover nested text/project files, exact sensitive
      roots/directories, `*.env`, hidden/generated/package paths, skipped-path redaction, symlink loops,
      empty/oversized/500-entry folders, the 64-attempt safety ceiling, and global context accounting.
      `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds pass. Physical drag/UI regression smoke remains
      manual because the repository has no UI-test target and another Xcode-launched Dragaway instance
      is currently running.

**Deliberate first-version boundary:** images, media, and rich-text/Office documents appear in the
manifest but their contents are not sent as part of a folder request. Local Vision OCR, a cancellable
Office parser, and an explicit multi-call deep-analysis mode can be added later; none should silently
add latency, UI stalls, or provider cost to the default folder drop.

## Hierarchical header model menu (DONE 2026-07-25)

**Scope:** keep the existing native macOS header menu and exact model-selection routing, but make a
large live catalogue navigable as Provider → model family/generation → exact model. Reduce only the
compact model label in the pill header; do not restyle native menu rows.

- [x] Add stable, presentation-only provider/family groups derived from the existing enabled model
      choices, including current and future OpenAI, Claude, Gemini/Gemma, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek,
      Mistral, Groq-hosted, and Ollama identifiers.
- [x] Replace the flat inline picker with nested native `Menu` submenus and a leaf `Picker`, preserving
      the exact selected-model checkmark, unavailable state, Hosted choice, and Provider Settings.
- [x] Make the trigger label visibly smaller, then run diff checks and Debug/Release builds without
      touching the model catalogue, provider resolution, or the in-progress folder-drop behavior.

## Finder-style folder content selection (IN PROGRESS 2026-07-28)

**Scope:** let users decide which supported children of a dropped folder may enter the next AI
request, directly inside the existing folder popover. Preserve the canonical manifest, bounded
single-call context, unsupported-file visibility, fixed overlay geometry, and all non-folder drops.

- [x] Keep the scanned source manifest separately from the prepared result and maintain one
      session-local selection set per folder. Default to every supported file so existing folder
      behavior is unchanged.
- [x] Rebuild only the bounded folder context after a selection change (never rescan), cancel stale
      rebuilds, and make a concurrently started AI action await the newest selection-specific result.
      Redact deselected child paths as well as their contents from provider context.
- [x] Add Finder-style interaction to the native popover: click for a single selection/deselection,
      Command- or Control-click for additive toggles, Shift-click for a contiguous range, Command-A
      for every supported file, and Space for Quick Look of the current selected file(s).
- [x] Clearly distinguish selected, context-omitted, deselected, and unsupported rows without making
      unsupported entries selectable; keep every dimension scaled with `uiScale`.
- [ ] Verify focused selection/context fixtures, `git diff --check`, and Debug + Release builds; then
      manually smoke the popover modifiers, Command-A, Space, and immediate action-after-selection.
      Automated checks pass: a real-extractor smoke fixture verified selected content inclusion,
      deselected content/path redaction, and immediate analysis awaiting the newest debounced rebuild;
      `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds pass. Physical modifier/Quick Look interaction
      remains for the owner because the active Xcode-launched Dragaway process predates this build and
      the repository has no UI-test target.

### Selection correction: stable filters and one-time preparation (COMPLETE 2026-07-28)

- [x] Make the preview tabs capability-based (`All` / `Supported` / `Skipped`) rather than derived
      from mutable selection/context outcomes. A supported row must remain in the active tab while it
      is toggled; terminal extraction failures and safety-limit omissions stay visible but unselectable.
- [x] Split bounded folder preparation from context assembly: extract each supported file at most once
      per session under the existing 64-file / 64-MiB / four-second safety limits, then retain only its
      bounded local text or terminal preparation result in a session-local cache.
- [x] On selection changes, rebuild manifest statuses and the provider envelope entirely from that
      immutable cache. Do no filesystem reads, keep the selected row in the active tab, and make an
      immediately started AI action await the newest assembly.
- [x] Add regression coverage for tab membership, reselect without extractor work, deselected
      path/content redaction, context-limit changes, cancellation, and session reset; then run
      `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds.

Verification: focused cache/store smoke harnesses passed using the production folder-analysis code.
They deleted the source files after initial preparation, then deselected/reselected files and changed
the context limit successfully, proving those interactions used cached text instead of reopening the
files. Immediate `analysis(for:)` returned the newest selection, deselected paths/content stayed
redacted, and `cancelAll()` cleared the cache. `git diff --check`, Debug, and Release builds passed.

## Release v1.1.5 (DONE 2026-07-31)

**Scope:** ship the accumulated live-product work on `main` since v1.1.4. Keep `thesis` untouched.
The user-facing scope is reliable website-content extraction, bounded folder drops with selectable
contents, the hierarchical native model menu, and the associated async/session reliability fixes.

- [x] Audit every tracked and untracked release path, exclude build artefacts or unrelated work, and
      derive truthful v1.1.5 release notes from the complete `v1.1.4..main` plus working-tree delta.
- [x] Bump the app and extension to marketing version 1.1.5 / build 8; update the README headline and
      add `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.5.md`.
- [x] Run `git diff --check`, focused web/folder regressions, and clean Debug + Release builds. Review
      the exact staged diff before committing only the intended product and release files.
- [x] Commit and push the reviewed v1.1.5 source on `main`, create and push annotated tag `v1.1.5`,
      then build, Developer-ID sign, notarize, staple, and validate `Dragaway-1.1.5.dmg`.
      Release-gate correction: the first accepted/stapled DMG contained a notarized Developer-ID app
      but the disk-image container itself had no usable code signature. The release helper now signs
      the DMG before submission; the corrected rebuild passed code-signing, notarization, stapling,
      Gatekeeper, mounted-app, and remote-download hash checks before publication.
- [x] Confirm the current Sparkle entry has an EdDSA signature, publish the GitHub release with the
      notarized DMG, then commit/push `appcast.xml` last so installed clients never see a missing asset.
- [x] Verify the public release asset, notarization/Gatekeeper state, version/build metadata, GitHub
      release, and live appcast URL/signature after publication.

Verification: clean Debug and Release builds passed; app and extension report `1.1.5 (8)` and bundle
Readability plus its licence. The final 4,550,142-byte DMG is Developer-ID signed, accepted by Apple
under notary submission `875a1232-8a29-4946-bcd1-9d7d62ec0414`, stapled, and accepted by Gatekeeper.
GitHub serves the exact local SHA-256 `b976bd6563c3a7f4e77443dc28c40730f5df39163c255b05607d4a802adf1fc6`;
the public `main` appcast exposes build 8 with the matching length and EdDSA signature.

## Session sharing v2 — security hardening (IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-06; live/deployment smoke pending)

**Scope:** replace the unreleased `/v1` sharing prototype on `main` with a bounded, authenticated v2
snapshot protocol. Preserve the explicit opt-in and fork semantics: any number of colleagues may
independently open the same exposed snapshot, including one after another, until the sender revokes
it or its 24-hour lifetime ends. Use only Apple system crypto in
the Mac app: the deliberate no-third-party-dependency decision remains, so the password tier uses
CommonCrypto PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 rather than Argon2id. Do not deploy, push, release, or merge into
`thesis` as part of implementation; those are separate owner-authorised operations.

- [x] **Write the threat model and migration contract first** — add a focused hardening record that
      maps every reviewed weakness to its fix, explains the security boundary of both tiers, records
      residual risks (a guessed six-digit unprotected session ID, server-readable code-only shares,
      offline guessing of weak passwords, normal TLS trust), and states why v1 is deliberately
      incompatible/disabled. Update the architecture,
      privacy report, self-host guide, retention wording (including D1 Time Travel/backups), endpoint
      reference, and `tasks/lessons.md` security rules to match code exactly.
- [x] **Preserve the deliberate six-digit baseline honestly** — the sender still receives one
      CSPRNG-generated six-digit Session ID and the recipient still enters only those six digits.
      Treat it explicitly as a short-lived bearer credential for uncritical material: a valid ID
      necessarily identifies and claims an unprotected share, so no documentation may pretend that
      a per-share “wrong PIN” counter makes the one-million-value space cryptographically strong.
      Use a sender-generated opaque 128-bit storage ID after the rate-limited lookup, with separate
      capabilities: one sender-generated persistent 256-bit owner token authenticates revoke, while every successful
      recipient lookup receives its own short-lived claim token for bounded download retries. There
      is no product-level recipient/fetch cap and one recipient never consumes the Session ID for the
      next. Store only token verifiers and compare fixed-size values safely. The password remains the
      opt-in second layer for confidential material.
- [x] **Define a versioned, bounded cryptographic envelope** — replace JSON-embedded file `Data` and
      JSON/base64 transport with a small length-prefixed binary bundle (metadata JSON + raw file
      bytes) encrypted as raw AES-256-GCM bytes. Enforce v2, one regular primary file, 25 MiB artifact,
      bounded metadata/turn counts/string lengths, and a bounded total ciphertext size on both sides.
      Reject folders and multi-file sessions before upload with an explicit explanation rather than
      silently sharing an incomplete session.
- [x] **Use the native password KDF correctly** — replace the custom repeated-HMAC construction with
      CommonCrypto PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at a documented 600,000-iteration work factor and a random
      32-byte salt. Put `cryptoVersion`, KDF name, salt, iteration count, and limits in authenticated,
      validated metadata so future formats can migrate safely. Require a 12–256-byte passphrase and
      explain that password entropy still matters. Perform file I/O, packing, PBKDF2, and AES work
      off the main actor; retain the dependency-free design and leave Argon2id as a future format,
      not a misleading TODO in the active guarantee.
- [x] **Move payloads to bounded binary R2 storage** — stream the raw request body from the Worker to
      a private R2 binding after an exact `Content-Length`/header/schema check; stream R2 back to an
      authenticated recipient. Keep filenames and transcript details only inside ciphertext. In the
      code-only tier, wrap the server-held AES key under a Worker secret before D1 storage; document
      honestly that the service can still decrypt that tier. Never send `X-Device-Id` on sharing.
- [x] **Make protocol state transitions authoritative and atomic** — use a new D1 v2 schema and
      single-statement/transactional conditional writes for pending→ready creation, unique live-code
      reservation, independent recipient claims, per-claim download retries, revoke, and expiry.
      Eliminate
      select-then-update code
      allocation/counter races. Apply both a Cloudflare burst limiter and an exact D1 abuse budget
      keyed by a secret-HMAC of the connecting IP; never trust a caller-provided identity header.
      Ensure unknown IDs, invalid tokens, and internal failures return stable generic errors.
- [x] **Authenticate every destructive or data-bearing route** — create accepts the sender-generated
      share ID and already-persisted owner credential, then echoes only the share ID; each claim consumes the rate-limited six-digit Session ID and returns an independent
      short-lived claim token; payload reads require that claim token and revoke requires the owner
      token. Remove delete-on-ACK entirely: a successful recipient import only discards/expires that
      recipient's capability and never deletes the shared snapshot. Cache one fetched ciphertext
      locally in the Join flow so password retries are offline and do not consume more claims or
      downloads. Add `Cache-Control: no-store`, no cookies,
      no permissive CORS, no secrets/IDs in logs, and an ephemeral no-cache macOS URLSession that
      refuses cross-origin redirects and accepts HTTPS only (localhost HTTP solely for development).
- [x] **Harden expiry, cleanup, and operations** — keep a share retrievable by independently
      rate-limited recipients until explicit owner revoke or 24-hour expiry; neither the first nor any
      later successful import changes that lifetime. Make expired shares logically inaccessible on
      every route, then delete R2 payload + D1 share/claim metadata via cron. Add and document a
      two-day R2 lifecycle backstop without claiming exact physical deletion timing. Move the Worker
      to strict TypeScript, generated binding types, current compatibility date, JSONC config,
      structured privacy-safe observability, placeholder self-host config, migrations, package lock,
      deployment checklist, and a real MIT licence. Keep production resource identifiers separate
      from the copyable self-host template.
- [x] **Make imported files and history untrusted-data safe** — validate bundle/version/crypto fields,
      regular-file status, supported type, safe basename, Unicode/control/path components, and all
      declared lengths before writing. Prove the standardized destination remains inside the private
      Drops directory, write through a same-directory temporary file, and atomically rename without
      overwriting. Create one imported history record preserving original turn order/dates, return its
      ID, and restore it through `openHistorySession(id:)` so the visible transcript and later turns
      remain attached to that exact record rather than being cleared or duplicated.
- [x] **Fix app lifecycle and revocation UX** — derive the exposed turns from the active history ID,
      not the first matching filesystem path. Rebuild/reset Expose and Join state on every presentation
      and clear retained windows through `NSWindowDelegate` when the native close button/⌘W is used.
      Persist active-share metadata locally and its owner token in Keychain, show active shares in the
      menu, and allow authenticated revoke until expiry even after the Expose window was closed.
      Remove local records only after a confirmed `204` revoke response or their locally tracked expiry;
      generic `404` responses retain the recovery capability for retry.
- [x] **Make self-hosting real and safe** — add a Session Sharing settings field backed by a validated
      URL override (HTTPS, or loopback HTTP for development), preserve the hosted default, notify the
      app to re-arm sharing hotkeys, and store each active share's originating endpoint so changing
      servers cannot send its revoke token to the wrong host. Explain exactly what a custom operator
      can observe and which tier remains E2EE.
- [x] **Verify security properties, not just compilation** — add Workers-runtime Vitest coverage for
      malformed/oversized bodies, raw R2 storage, concurrent claim/fetch limits, IP budgets, expiry,
      generic errors, token-gated payload/revoke, cleanup, and no-store headers. Prove that multiple
      recipients can claim and download sequentially/concurrently, while each claim has only a small
      retry window and no recipient can revoke or consume the share for others. Add a Swift smoke
      harness over the production bundle/crypto/invite/import-policy code covering PBKDF2 vectors,
      round trips, wrong passwords, corruption, every traversal form, limit bombs, and forgiving
      six-digit Session-ID parsing. Run `wrangler types`, strict typecheck/lint, Worker tests, dry-run bundle,
      `git diff --check`, and clean Debug + Release Xcode builds.
- [x] **Close final local consistency audit findings** — restarting on the same file now arms a fresh
      lazy History identity; failed streams commit exactly the result still visible; imported files
      hold concrete count/byte/temp/final-path reservations through a throwing History write; and
      bounded File-Promise leases protect Safari/Photos/Mail output until MainActor handoff. Every
      prune also protects pending Add/Replace files.
- [ ] **Complete the deployment/live owner smoke** — after the v2 Worker schema, secrets, R2 lifecycle,
      and code are deployed, exercise expose/revoke/reopen, two or more sequential recipients in both
      code-only and password tiers, wrong-password retry without refetch, expired share, malicious
      filename fixture, and transcript continuation on the real service/two Macs.

**Deployment gate:** backend schema/R2/secrets/lifecycle and v2 Worker must be deployed and smoke-tested
before an app build containing the v2 client is distributed. The old public `/v1` endpoints are disabled
rather than kept as an unauthenticated compatibility path; any prototype v1 shares are allowed to expire.

**Non-blocking retention follow-up:** ordinary locally materialised text/web/image drops still write
first and run best-effort retention afterward. If all 50 / 512 MiB are protected, that path can exceed
the quota without deleting referenced data. Move those existing producers onto the same preflight
reservation API in a dedicated drag-pipeline change; do not mix it into the release-blocking sharing
fix because web placeholders can grow during background enrichment and need their own size contract.

## Responsive selectable multi-file shelf (PLANNED 2026-08-08)

**Scope:** replace the chips/result header's fixed two-icon pager with one responsive full-width file
shelf. Every staged file starts selected; this presentation selection controls only the native macOS
Share button and drag-out payload. It must not silently change AI context, Favorite Tools, folder
analysis, session history, or the v2 online Expose contract, which currently accepts one regular file.

- [x] Add session-scoped transfer selection to `OverlayViewModel` using deselected standardized paths,
      so new files are selected by default and selection survives stage transitions, minimize/restore,
      removal/promotion, and path remaps without becoming a second source of truth for session files.
- [x] Redesign `FilePillsRow` responsively: one file retains the full-width detailed pill; two files
      divide all available file-track width equally with one standalone trailing Share button; three or
      more become icon-first overlapping cards whose spacing/padding derives from available geometry and
      file count. Hover expands/reveals one filename, raises it above neighbours, and moves through the
      shelf with one smooth Reduce-Motion-aware animation instead of paging arrows.
- [x] Make selection unmistakable but quiet: selected by default, click to deselect/reselect, dim and
      outline deselected cards, preserve folder/file preview through a secondary gesture, and disable the
      Share button when no file is selected. The native Share sheet receives only selected URLs in their
      original session order.
- [x] Replace the single-provider SwiftUI drag source with a small AppKit multi-item drag source. Dragging
      a selected card writes one native dragging item per selected URL; dragging a deselected card first
      makes that file the sole transfer selection. Preserve the existing drag-out collapse lifecycle and
      Finder-compatible file URL payloads.
- [ ] Verify selection lifecycle and ordered payload helpers, `git diff --check`, Debug + Release builds,
      and manual UI smoke at 1, 2, 3, 5, and dense file counts: selection, zero-selection Share disabled,
      multi-file Share, multi-file drag to Finder, hover traversal, Quick Look/folder preview, removal,
      minimize/restore, result/back navigation, Reduce Motion, and every `uiScale` setting.

## Unified non-selectable multi-file field (PLANNED 2026-08-08)

**Correction:** remove the transfer-selection and hover-reveal interaction again. A multi-file session
is one fixed, full-width file field: Share and drag-out always include every staged file. The field is
never a window-move surface; moving the overlay remains available only through its visible top grabber.

- [x] Remove transfer-selection state and its minimize/restore/remap lifecycle from the view model.
- [x] Replace the individual multi-file cards with one non-hovering full-width field whose entire
      content area starts one native multi-item drag for all session URLs; keep Share inside at right.
- [x] Remove whole-card window dragging so file drags cannot race it; retain the explicit top grabber.
- [x] Verify `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds; leave real Finder drag/UI smoke explicit.

## Session files browser popover (PLANNED 2026-08-08)

**Scope:** clicking the non-Share part of the full-width session file field opens a compact native-style
grid/list browser. Its single blue focus selection exists only for navigation; Share and drag-out still
operate on every staged file and there is no transfer-selection mode.

- [x] Add a responsive grid/list popover with local single-file selection, thumbnails, names, sizes,
      total file count/size, and clear blue focus treatment.
- [x] Route `Space` to Quick Look for the focused file and `Return`/`Delete` to a centralized session
      removal operation; disable removal while an AI turn is active.
- [x] Make primary-file promotion and additional-file removal update live/cached stage URLs, local
      folder analysis, cached context, and active History paths without re-parsing eagerly.
- [x] Remove the “Click to preview” copy while preserving whole-field multi-file drag-out and the
      separate Share target; verify `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds.

## Unified file fan card (PLANNED 2026-08-09)

**Scope:** give single- and multi-file sessions the same full-width information card. The card remains
one native drag source; overlapping icons are presentation only, with hover choosing which filename and
size are shown. The session browser keeps one local focus selection and removes it only with Backspace.

- [x] Replace the special two-file layout and dense strip with one overlapping large-icon fan for every
      multi-file count; keep a single stable filename/size column beside it.
- [x] Track fan hover inside the existing native drag source so text changes do not split or obstruct
      the full-field multi-file drag hitbox.
- [x] Enlarge the single-file icon and replace instructional subtitle copy with the actual file size;
      keep folder detail access and Share behavior intact.
- [x] Bind removal only to macOS Backspace (`keyCode 51` / SwiftUI `.delete`), update shared header
      height math, and verify `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds.

## Dense file fan metadata row (PLANNED 2026-08-09)

**Scope:** keep the unified full-field drag source while giving sessions with six or more files a
two-row presentation. Tooltips expose complete filenames without reintroducing per-file hit targets.

- [x] Make the model-menu trigger explicitly smaller without changing the native menu contents.
- [x] Keep 2–5 files in the compact row; from 6 files place the fan in row one and the hovered
      filename/size in row two, within the existing shared header-height budget.
- [x] Feed full filenames into the native hover tracker so each fan position updates the AppKit
      tooltip and no “Click to browse” copy remains; verify diff hygiene and both build modes.

## Stable file-fan hover geometry (PLANNED 2026-08-10)

**Scope:** correct the over-aggressive model-label reduction and make the overlapping file fan's
visual order and native hover map describe the same immutable geometry.

- [x] Restore the model label to a readable size that remains visibly subordinate to the file type.
- [x] Replace offset-positioned fan tiles with equal-step negative-spacing layout and keep their base
      stacking order stable while hover supplies only a small vertical lift/emphasis.
- [x] Bound native hover to the fan's actual X and Y rectangle in both compact and stacked layouts,
      including the raised edge, so space above/below the tiles cannot select a file.
- [x] Record the overlap/z-order lesson, then verify diff hygiene plus Debug and Release builds.

## File-fan direct preview click (PLANNED 2026-08-10)

**Scope:** keep one native full-card drag source while routing a completed click according to the
already-validated fan hover index.

- [x] Increase the model trigger from 7 pt to a still-secondary but more comfortable readable size.
- [x] Re-evaluate the exact fan hover on mouse-down, then Quick Look only that file when the click
      finishes without becoming a drag; retain the session Gallery click everywhere else.
- [x] Preserve Space, Share, and multi-file drag behavior; verify diff hygiene plus both build modes.

## File presentation performance pass (PLANNED 2026-08-10)

**Scope:** remove filesystem I/O from the file-card hover and session-browser render paths, while
keeping thumbnail memory strictly bounded and preserving the fan's deterministic hit geometry.

- [x] Load directory/file-size metadata off-main once per standardized session path, cache a small
      bounded snapshot, and render the single-file card, multi-file hover text, gallery rows, and
      gallery total exclusively from that snapshot.
- [x] Quantize Quick Look requests to small Retina-aware pixel buckets, coalesce identical in-flight
      requests, and hold completed images in a cost-limited cache so no view retains oversized source
      artwork or repeatedly regenerates the same thumbnail.
- [x] Reconcile the hovered file's visual elevation with the fan's stable overlap/hit-test order so
      foreground emphasis does not reintroduce the previously fixed uneven spacing or hover mismatch.
- [x] Verify `git diff --check` plus Debug and Release builds; leave the real local/iCloud file-count
      interaction matrix to the owner in the final release candidate.

## Keyboard interaction polish (PLANNED 2026-08-10)

**Scope:** restore reliable Finder-style Backspace removal in the session-files popover and make
single-line dialog forms consistently executable with Return, without stealing Return from multiline
editors or broadening any global-keyboard/accessibility surface.

- [x] Replace the popover's timing-sensitive SwiftUI focus binding with a popover-local native first
      responder that handles only Space and physical Backspace (`keyCode 51`), reclaims focus after
      file/layout clicks, and preserves the existing removal guards and deferred stage write.
- [x] Add one guarded primary action per custom form window: Expose/Join (including password fields),
      onboarding, hotkey save, compression, tutorial progression, and first-result session search.
      Add field-local Return submission for Settings values, while leaving multiline feedback input
      and non-form destructive actions untouched.
- [x] Record the keyboard-focus/default-action lesson, run `git diff --check`, and build Debug and
      Release serially; leave the final Backspace/Space and enabled/disabled Return interaction matrix
      to the owner in the release candidate.

## Session Sharing — up to five files (IMPLEMENTED 2026-08-10 — automated verification green; owner live/UI smoke pending)

**Scope:** Expose may snapshot one through five regular staged files, in session order. Folders,
symbolic links, empty sessions, and six or more files remain blocked by the existing native warning.
The existing 25 MiB source-payload ceiling becomes an aggregate limit across the files, so the Worker
transport/storage bound and the local 512 MiB Drops policy do not silently expand.

- [x] **Make the sender boundary explicit** — validate the complete staged URL set before opening the
      Expose panel; accept only 1–5 existing regular non-symlink files. Keep the warning path for a
      folder or 6+ files and update its copy to state the exact limit instead of claiming that every
      multi-file session is unsupported.
- [x] **Add an honest multi-file disclosure** — pass the immutable URL snapshot into the Expose panel,
      show total count/size plus every filename, and add a conspicuous warning for 2–5 files that all
      listed files will be encrypted and shared. Tell the user to verify the list/remove unintended
      files before continuing; do not add a second selection model inside the sharing dialog.
- [x] **Version the encrypted bundle without breaking existing shares** — continue emitting/accepting
      bundle v2 for one-file snapshots; add a bounded v3 envelope for 2–5 files with canonical ordered
      filename/length metadata and concatenated raw bytes. Decode both versions, authenticate the exact
      bundle version in AES-GCM AAD, reject duplicate/unsafe names, folders, length bombs, more than five
      files, or more than 25 MiB aggregate before variable-size allocation.
- [x] **Keep the relay rollout compatible** — allow bundle versions 2 and 3 on create/claim while keeping
      crypto protocol v2, request limits, R2 format, Session IDs, password semantics, and existing D1
      rows unchanged. Add Worker tests proving legacy v2 rows still claim and new v3 descriptors round
      trip; document that the updated Worker must deploy before the app can expose multi-file sessions.
- [x] **Import the recipient snapshot transactionally** — validate all file types/names first, reserve
      count, aggregate bytes, collision-safe final names, and distinct temp names for the whole batch;
      persist every file with mode 0600 and create one History session (`primary` + ordered `additional`)
      before releasing leases. On any failure, remove only this batch's uncommitted files and leave no
      partial session or orphan.
- [x] **Verify the real contract** — expand the Swift security smoke for v2 compatibility, 2-file and
      5-file round trips, duplicate basenames, malformed offsets/lengths, 6-file/folder rejection,
      aggregate size bounds, and batch rollback. Run Worker typecheck/tests/dry-run, Swift smoke,
      `git diff --check`, and serial Debug + Release builds; leave two-Mac code-only/password transfer
      and the visible 1/2/5/6-file disclosure matrix to the release candidate.

## Capture current product work for the next release (DONE 2026-08-10)

**Scope:** commit the complete reviewed `main` worktree without publishing or releasing it. Preserve a
user-facing, version-neutral summary of the working-tree diff against `HEAD` so a later release pass can
merge it with any additional changes and assign the final version number.

- [x] Inventory the complete tracked and untracked diff against `HEAD` and separate user-facing changes
      from implementation/security details.
- [x] Add `RELEASE_NOTES_NEXT.md` covering the hardened sharing protocol, five-file sharing, session-file
      presentation/performance, keyboard polish, and the relevant privacy boundaries.
- [x] Re-run diff hygiene, review the exact staged paths and staged diff, then create one local `main`
      commit without pushing, tagging, version-bumping, or releasing.

## Last saved file → session hotkey (COMPLETE 2026-08-11)

**Scope:** `⌃⌘L` opens the newest stable, supported user file from configured folders in a fresh
Dragaway session. The feature is local, enabled by default, independently disableable, and uses no
Accessibility API. It observes paths/metadata only; file content is not read until the user invokes the
hotkey and the normal session pipeline takes over.

- [x] Add one persisted observable configuration with Desktop, Documents, and Downloads as defaults;
      allow watched folders and excluded subtrees to be added/removed in Settings. Normalize and dedupe
      path ancestry, let exclusions always win, and restart the stream on every relevant change.
- [x] Add a low-idle FSEvents stream with file-level events and a one-shot Spotlight bootstrap. Ignore
      app/system/cache/temp/hidden paths, directories, packages, symlinks, unsupported types, and
      Dragaway's internal storage; coalesce bursts and require stable size + modification date off-main.
- [x] Keep a small newest-first in-memory candidate buffer so deleted atomic-save paths fall back safely.
      The hotkey may briefly await a pending stability pass, then must reuse
      `AppDelegate.openSessionWithFiles([url])` without copying or eagerly parsing the file.
- [x] Register/unregister permission-free `⌃⌘L` through the existing Carbon `GlobalHotkey`, tied to the
      master toggle. Add the shortcut, privacy/performance explanation, include/exclude controls, current
      detected file, and reset-to-default action to Capture Settings and Help.
- [x] Verify path/filter/config helpers, `git diff --check`, Debug then Release builds, and idle lifecycle
      (start, stop, reconfigure). Leave final live Word export/download, protected-folder permission, and
      Energy Log checks explicit for the owner.

## Capture Settings as a top-level menu item (2026-08-12)

- [x] Move “Capture Settings…” from the Clipboard History submenu into the status menu's primary
      settings list.
- [x] Rename the scoped settings destination and visible section from “Clipboard & Capture” to
      “Capture Settings” without changing any capture defaults, hotkeys, or watcher behavior.
- [x] Update the Help reference, run diff hygiene, and verify a Debug build.

## Customize submenu (2026-08-12)

- [x] Replace the separate “Custom Prompts” and “Favorite Tools” status-menu rows with one native
      “Customize” submenu that links to both existing scoped settings windows.
- [x] Verify menu wiring, diff hygiene, and a Debug build without changing either settings screen.

## Release v1.1.6 (2026-08-12)

- [x] Confirm `main`, inventory the complete `v1.1.5..main` plus working-tree delta, and verify no
      credentials or test secrets are included.
- [x] Finalize `RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.6.md` from `RELEASE_NOTES_NEXT.md`, add the last-saved-file and
      batch-compression work, omit menu-only reordering, and update README What's New.
- [x] Bump app and extension to marketing version 1.1.6 / build 9; run diff hygiene and a Debug build.
- [ ] Stage exact release-source paths, review the staged diff, and commit the complete Main release
      source without pushing or tagging.
- [ ] Run `scripts/release.sh`; verify Developer-ID signing, Apple notarization, stapling, DMG version,
      and the Sparkle EdDSA signature. Leave publishing and the generated appcast commit for an explicit
      follow-up request.
