# Dragaway

**Your daily tools, one drag away.**

Dragaway (fka AI-Drop) is a native macOS menu-bar app that turns your physical notch into a universal drag-router. Start dragging *anything* — a file, a text selection, a link, an image from the web — and a pill emerges from the notch. Drop it to get instant AI actions, run local file conversions, or flick it into any of your favorite apps with a radial launcher. No browser, no chat window, no context switching.

## What's New in v1.7.5

- **Open the current selection with `⌃⌘G`** — with optional Enhanced Access enabled, select text, a
  link, an image, or files in the current app and launch them directly into a Dragaway session.
- **Clipboard-safe selection capture** — Dragaway restores the previous clipboard immediately and
  keeps the temporary Copy round trip out of its own Clipboard History.
- **Consistent appearance in Light Mode** — the purpose-built dark interface remains dark and
  readable regardless of the macOS appearance setting.

## What's New in v1.1.7

- **Live streaming on Dragaway Free** — replies appear word by word on the hosted free tier, not just
  with your own API key, and the shelf grows smoothly with the answer instead of after it.
- **Double the daily free allowance** — 60,000 tokens per day on Free and 400,000 on Pro. Existing
  installs pick this up automatically.
- **Follow-up prompts suggested by the model** — each answer proposes up to six next prompts that fit
  what you asked, instead of a fixed list. Clicking one sends it as if you had typed it.
- **Batch compression you can cancel** — image and video runs show live progress and can be stopped,
  cleaning up exactly the files that run produced and nothing else.

## What's New in v1.1.6

- **Share sessions with colleagues** — expose the current session and let multiple colleagues open its
  immutable file snapshot with a six-digit code. Add a password for end-to-end encryption, or revoke an
  active share at any time.
- **A much stronger multi-file workspace** — stage, preview, and drag multiple files in one session, and
  share up to five regular files together. The compact file fan and Finder-style gallery use cached
  metadata and small thumbnails for smooth interaction.
- **Launch the latest saved file with `⌃⌘L`** — watch configurable folders for a recent download, export,
  or save and open the newest supported file directly in Dragaway. The local watcher is independently
  disableable and needs no Accessibility permission.
- **Batch image and video compression** — configure and run one compression job across multiple staged
  images or videos.
- **Keyboard and dialog polish** — Space and Backspace behave consistently in the file gallery, while
  Return confirms primary actions throughout Dragaway's native dialogs.

---

## What's New in v1.1.5

- **Drop complete folders** — Dragaway scans folders locally within strict depth, size, file-count,
  and time limits. A transparent preview shows supported, omitted, and skipped files before one
  provider request explains the folder or answers a custom question.
- **Choose exactly which folder files are analysed** — the folder preview supports Finder-style
  selection, including Command/Control multi-select, Shift ranges, Command-A, and Space for Quick
  Look. Selection changes reuse the session's local extraction cache instead of parsing files again.
- **Far more reliable website understanding** — Safari tabs and URL drops now use Mozilla
  Readability for structured article extraction, with an isolated ephemeral rendered-page fallback
  for JavaScript-heavy sites. A fast action waits for that same bounded preparation task.
- **A navigable model menu** — the native macOS model picker is grouped by provider, model family,
  and exact model while the fixed Dragaway Free option stays simple.
- **Stronger session reliability** — overlapping AI turns, stale asynchronous results, renamed web
  drops, and folder-session restores are guarded so content cannot land in the wrong session.

---

## What's New in v1.1.4

- **Drop Apple Mail messages** — drag one or several inbox messages into the pill. Dragaway materializes them as `.eml`, extracts readable headers and body locally, and offers mail-specific actions such as Summarize, Tell Me What to Do, and Deadlines & Risks.
- **Redesigned session header** — the file type and active AI model now sit in a compact top row, with the full-width file pill below. Mail and Safari-origin files get contextual icons without changing the underlying files.
- **Choose the exact BYOK model** — refresh the live model catalogue for OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq, or Ollama and select the precise model Dragaway should call. Missing models stay visible instead of being silently replaced.
- **Faster Clipboard History workflow** — selection always returns focus to the app you were using. Optional, default-off **Enhanced Access** can paste the selected text, image, or file immediately.
- **More accurate browser image drops** — image-result drags now preserve the visible image instead of turning a mixed image/URL payload into a page-text file.
- **Visual polish** — a transparent Dragaway menu-bar icon plus tighter, more responsive card alignment.

---

## What's New in v1.1.3

- **Core features need no permissions** — Drag detection, hotkeys, the radial launcher, and Esc work out of the box. The newer, default-off **Enhanced Access** option requests Accessibility only if you explicitly enable instant Clipboard History paste.

---

## What's New in v1.1.2

- **Drop Safari (and other non-Chromium) browser tabs into Dragaway** — dragging a tab from Safari, or any non-Chromium browser, now lands in the pill like a file or link. Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Arc, Brave) already worked; this closes the gap for the rest.

---

## What's New in v1.1.1

- Dragaway now supports assets beyond just files. You can drag. and drop literally anything. Files, Safari tabs, Selections and more
- Launch your current clipboard directly to Dragaway session with ⌃⌘N
- You can now add taken screenshots automatically in a Session.
- Dragaway can now be updated natively without a need to reinstalling the .dmg.

---

## What's New in v1.1

- **Radial launcher — a second drag mode** — hold a key as you start dragging a file and a **wheel of your favorite apps** fans out around the cursor. Flick toward a wedge and release to open the file in that app — no drop target to aim for, no menu to click. The apps come from your **Favorite Tools**, category-aware for the file you're dragging.
- **"Start Session" slot** — the wheel can include Dragaway itself: a larger **Start Session** slot at the top-centre routes the file straight into the AI card instead of an external app. Toggle it with **Show Dragaway in Launcher**.
- **Two independent drag modes, one place to set them** — the **Drag Hotkeys** window now configures the **notch pill** (AI & utilities) and the **radial launcher** separately. Give each its own modifier, switch either off entirely, or leave a mode keyless to make it the default — leave **both** keyless and a single drag shows the pill *and* the wheel together.
- **Pill ↔ wheel handoff** — when both appear, dragging up toward the notch hands the file to the pill (start an AI session) while flicking out to a wedge opens an app. The launcher only releases its selection as you approach the pill, so an outward flick still launches reliably.
- **Real file icons** — a dropped file now shows its **actual Quick Look thumbnail** (the image itself, a PDF's first page, a video poster frame) instead of a generic type icon.
- **Faster & snappier** — the action card appears **instantly** on drop (the content peek that tunes suggested prompts now runs in the background), **Tab / Shift+Tab** cycle the prompt tabs, the close / minimize buttons have larger hit targets, and the drop pill is a clean flat-black surface that looks identical in light and dark mode.

---

## What's New in v0.9.9

- **Favorite apps — "Open in" row** — Pick your go-to apps in **Settings → Favorite Tools**, then open any dropped file in them with a single click — or press **⌥1 … ⌥9**. The numbered row appears on both the action card and the result card.
- **Clipboard history** — Dragaway keeps your **last 20 clipboard items** (text, images, and files). Press **⌃⌘V** for a quick picker of the **last 10**. Selection always returns focus to the app you were using: press **⌘V** yourself in the permission-free mode, or enable **Enhanced Access** for immediate paste-on-pick. The full 20 live in the menu bar under **Clipboard History** (⌥-click a row to remove just that one). Items from password managers (anything marked sensitive/concealed) are **never** captured, and your history survives a restart. Turn it off anytime with **Track Clipboard**.
- **A local file toolbox — no uploads, no API key** — every file pill's **•••** menu now offers a large set of pure-Apple-framework tools that run entirely on your Mac:
  - **PDF** — Export as Text · Split into Pages · Pages to Images · Stitch PDFs
  - **Images** — Convert to JPEG · Convert to PDF · Resize / Compress · Remove Metadata (EXIF)
  - **Video & audio** — Extract Audio · Transcribe · Convert to GIF · Extract Frame · Compress Video · Remove Audio · Convert to MP4 / MOV / M4A
  - **Text, code & data** — Sort Lines · Remove Duplicate Lines · Count Lines / Words · SHA-256 Checksum · Base64 Encode / Decode · Pretty-Print / Minify JSON · CSV ⇄ JSON
  - **Any file** — Compress to .zip · Show in Finder · Rename · Move to…
- **Drop video & audio — even without an AI key** — media files are now first-class: drop one and you get the full utility toolbox and the Open-in row, no provider required.
- **Quick Look on click** — click a file pill to preview it full-size (the familiar spacebar preview): images, PDFs, video, audio, text, and code.
- **Result view for file tools** — when a tool creates a new file, Dragaway shows a result card placing the **new file next to the original**, with the size saved (e.g. "73 % smaller"), dimensions / pages / duration, and one-tap **Reveal in Finder** / **Quick Look**.
- **New app icon** plus assorted animation and centering polish.

---

## What's New in v0.9.8

- **Session history** — Dragaway now remembers your last **10 sessions** (the file *and* the full AI conversation). Open the menu-bar icon → **Recent Sessions** to reopen any of them right where you left off. Hold **⌥** to remove a single session, or **Clear History** to wipe them all.
- **File tools** — every file pill gets a **•••** menu: **Show in Finder**, **Rename**, **Move to…**, **PDF → text**, **Stitch PDFs**, and **Resize / Compress image** — all with pure Apple frameworks, no uploads.
- **Native share sheet** — sharing a file now opens the standard macOS share sheet (AirDrop, Messages, Mail, Copy, and every share extension you have installed).
- **Minimize & restore** — tuck an open session back into the notch with the **–** button and bring it back anytime from the menu bar.
- **Native menu-bar menu** — the menu-bar dropdown is now a real macOS menu with proper styling.
- **Polish** — the card now sits perfectly centred under the notch at every stage, the prompt-tab buttons have larger hit areas, and the action chips no longer clip on hover.

---

## What's New in v0.9.5

- **Prompt tabs** — the action card now has three tabs: **Suggested** (smart actions for the file), **History** (your recently typed prompts), and **Custom** (your own saved prompts). History and custom prompts are saved locally on your Mac.
- **Custom Prompts in Settings** — add, edit, and remove reusable prompts from the Settings window; they show up instantly in the Custom tab.
- **Hosted free tier** — start using Dragaway with **no API key**. A built-in Gemini-powered free tier (metered per device) lets you try every action before bringing your own key.
- **Explicit model selection** — bring your own Groq, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, or Ollama setup and choose an exact live model for each provider.
- **Multi-file sessions** — drop a second file onto an open card to analyse several files together, with a file gallery, per-file remove, and multi-file share.
- **Movable overlay** — drag the panel to reposition it anywhere on screen.
- **Snappier animations** — faster, tighter state transitions with reduced overbounce across the whole flow.

## How to Install

1. Download **Dragaway.dmg** from the [latest release](https://github.com/mwallbrecher/Dragaway/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG and drag **Dragaway** into your **Applications** folder
3. Launch the app — it lives in your **menu bar** (look for the ✦ icon)
4. On first launch, pick your AI provider and paste your API key
5. Drag any file toward the top of your screen to get started

> **Signed & notarized by Apple** — the DMG opens normally, no Gatekeeper workaround needed. Dragaway's core features work without special permissions. Accessibility is requested only if you explicitly turn on the default-off **Enhanced Access** option for instant Clipboard History paste.

---

## The Problem It Solves

Opening a file → switching to a browser → uploading it to an AI chat → waiting → copying the result back — this workflow has been measured at **17–41 seconds of task completion overhead** per interaction (Moritz Wallbrecher at Kingston University, 2026). That overhead compounds every time you need a summary, a translation, or a key-date extraction.

Dragaway eliminates every step except the one that matters: **what do you want to do with this file?**

---

## How It Works

```
Drag any file toward the top of your screen
        ↓
A pill drops from the notch  ←  liquid spring animation
        ↓
Drop the file onto the pill
        ↓
Instant AI action chips appear (Summarise · Translate · Extract Dates · …)
        ↓
Tap a chip  →  AI response renders inline with full Markdown formatting
        ↓
Done. Ask follow-ups right there, or open the file in any favorite app.
```

The entire flow happens in a floating black panel — no app switching, no typing, no prompts.

---

## Features

### Core Interaction
- **Drag detection** — monitors the system drag pasteboard; pill appears the moment a file drag is detected anywhere on screen
- **Notch-origin animation** — pill emerges from the physical notch with a two-phase liquid spring (notch mouth opens → pill drops with low-damping bounce)
- **Jelly hover** — single squash-rebound wobble on cursor enter; pill stays still for precise dropping
- **Shelf behaviour** — overlay stays open after a file is placed; acts as a temporary workspace

### AI Actions
- Summarise (bullets / short)
- Extract key dates
- Translate to German
- Rephrase (formal / casual)
- Extract key points
- Analyse image *(for image files)*
- Custom free-text prompt

### Result Panel
- **Markdown rendering** — bold, italic, headings, bullet & numbered lists, fenced code blocks, dividers — no raw tokens
- **Scrollable result** with text selection
- **Follow-up action chips** based on what was just run — the result is a real multi-turn conversation

### File Support
- PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown — full text extraction
- PNG, JPEG, GIF, HEIC, WebP — image analysis via vision models
- **Folders** — bounded local scan with an exact included/omitted/skipped manifest,
  a contents preview, and one-request project/folder understanding
- **Drag-out** — drag the file icon back out of the overlay to drop it anywhere in Finder

### AI Providers
| Provider | Model | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free tier** | Gemini 2.5 Flash (hosted) | Free, metered | No API key needed; try every action right away |
| **Groq** | Your selected live model | BYOK / free tier available | Loaded from your Groq account |
| **Gemini** | Your selected live model | BYOK | Loaded from Google AI; vision where supported |
| **Claude** | Your selected live model | BYOK | Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, and other available models |
| **ChatGPT** | Your selected live model | BYOK | Loaded from your OpenAI account |
| **Ollama** | Your selected installed model | Unlimited, free | Runs 100% on your Mac; no API bill |

The built-in **free tier** runs through a hosted metering proxy — the host key never ships in the app. BYOK model lists are refreshed from the provider and cached locally for 24 hours; Dragaway sends the exact model you selected and never silently substitutes another. Your own API keys are stored in **macOS Keychain** — never in files, never in the app bundle.

---

## Requirements

- **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later
- A Mac with a **notch** (MacBook Pro 14″ / 16″, MacBook Air M2+) — works on non-notch Macs too, pill appears at the top-center of the screen
- **Xcode 15** or later to build from source
- **No permissions required for core features** — drag detection, hotkeys, and the radial launcher all use ungated APIs (drag-pasteboard polling, global *mouse* monitors, Carbon hotkeys). Optional **Enhanced Access** appears in Privacy & Security only after you enable instant Clipboard History paste.

---

## Installation

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwallbrecher/Dragaway.git
cd Dragaway
open MacNotchAI.xcodeproj
```

1. Select the **MacNotchAI** scheme
2. Choose **My Mac** as the run destination
3. Press **⌘R** to build and run

> The app is **not sandboxed** — this is required for `NSEvent` global mouse monitoring. Core behavior never prompts: drag detection works out of the box, and Esc dismissal rides the window's responder chain. The only optional prompt follows an explicit **Enhanced Access** opt-in.

### First Launch

1. The app lives in your **menu bar** (look for the sparkle icon ✦)
2. On first launch the **provider setup sheet** opens automatically
3. Pick your provider, paste your API key, click **Get Started**
4. Drag any file toward the top of your screen

### Provider API Keys

| Provider | Where to get a key |
|---|---|
| Groq | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — free, takes ~60 seconds |
| Claude | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| ChatGPT | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Ollama | [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai) — no key needed, run `ollama pull llama3.1` |

## Architecture & Technical Approach

### The Stack

- **SwiftUI + AppKit hybrid** — `MenuBarExtra` for the menu bar icon, `NSPanel` (`OverlayWindow`) for the overlay, `NSHostingView` subclass (`DroppableHostingView`) for drag-and-drop reception
- **Swift Concurrency** — `async/await` for AI calls and animation sequencing; `@MainActor` throughout
- **Combine** — `@Published` stage changes flow through a Combine pipeline to resize the window
- **Small, audited dependency surface** — Apple frameworks for the app itself, Sparkle for updates,
  and a pinned Mozilla Readability script for local website-text extraction

### Key Engineering Decisions

**Global drag detection without Accessibility API abuse**
We monitor `NSPasteboard(name: .drag)` via `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(.leftMouseDragged)`. The drag pasteboard is written by the source app before the first drag event fires, so detecting a new drag is instant. A `changeCount` guard prevents stale pasteboard contents from triggering the pill on plain mouse moves.

**Drag-end detection during AppKit modal loop**
`NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(.leftMouseUp)` is silenced during an active AppKit drag session because macOS enters `.eventTracking` runloop mode. We use a `Timer` added to `.common` mode (fires in every runloop mode) that polls the drag pasteboard — when it empties, the drag ended.

**Window frame animation crash avoidance**
`NSAnimationContext { animator().setFrame() }` drives the window through intermediate sizes at 60 fps. AppKit runs a full constraint-solving layout pass on each intermediate frame; when those sizes are inconsistent with SwiftUI's fixed-width subviews the solver cannot converge → recursive "Update Constraints in Window" → `abort()`. Solution: **instant `setFrame(_:display:)`** — the window resizes in one step, SwiftUI transitions and spring modifiers handle all visual animation.

**Jelly wobble without clipping**
`scaleEffect` inside a `clipShape` clips the overflow. The wobble `scaleEffect` is applied at the `OverlayView` root — outside all clipping — using a 288×96 transparent canvas around the 240×68 pill. `anchor: .top` ensures all vertical expansion goes downward, so the pill never overflows upward into the notch.

**Animation task ownership**
During the 0.14 s dismiss fade, both the old and new `WaitingPillView` are live simultaneously. If both own a `Task` for the jelly animation, two concurrent `withAnimation{}` blocks targeting the same `@Published` properties cause a SwiftUI invariant violation (`_crashOnException`). Solution: the jelly `Task` is stored on `OverlayViewModel` (singleton); `startJellyHover()` always cancels the previous task before creating a new one.

**File content extraction**
- PDF → `PDFKit.PDFDocument` (first 20 pages / 12k chars)
- DOCX / DOC / RTF → `NSAttributedString` via the Cocoa text system (plain-text string)
- Plain text / code → `String(contentsOf:)` with encoding auto-detection + lossy fallback
- Images → passed as `URL` directly to vision-capable models
- Oversized sources are truncated to ~12k chars and flagged in the result UI

**Privacy model**
Ordinary local files are read only when the user explicitly taps an action chip. Website URL drops are
the exception: Dragaway immediately fetches the target page locally so its text is ready; when static
HTML is incomplete, a cookie-free ephemeral WebKit view may run the site's first-party rendering code.
Folder drops are also prepared locally in the background: traversal and text extraction are bounded,
never follow symlinks, and skip hidden/generated directories plus known key/secret files. The preview
shows exactly which files entered the context and which were omitted or skipped. DOC/DOCX/RTF files
remain available as direct drops, but recursive folder analysis lists and skips them because Apple's
rich-text importer is synchronous and cannot be safely cancelled during background preparation. A
single session scans at most four distinct folders; additional folders remain visible and are marked
as omitted instead of starting unbounded concurrent recursive work.
No document content is sent to an AI provider until the user starts an AI action. API keys never leave
the device except in their provider requests.

Accessibility is optional and off by default. When enabled, Dragaway uses event-posting access only to
send one ⌘V after a Clipboard History selection; it does not inspect another app's UI or accessibility tree.

## Inspired By

- Apple's **Dynamic Island** interaction philosophy — contextual, springy, alive
- My HCI research finding that **task-switching overhead** is the primary friction in AI-assisted workflows
- The idea that **the OS itself** is the best AI interface — not another app
